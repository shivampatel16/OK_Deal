Camera is neither the best nor the worst, it's quite good for this price point.  6000 mA battery 🔋👍🏻  Though it comes with a lot of bloatware but you can just uninstall most of them (excluding system apps)  Finally the Verdict is that it's a good budget smartphone",8 months ago,5103,25515

69,"POCO M3 (Cool Blue, 64 GB)",Sa********,5,Best in the market!,"1) Delivery on time, Properly packed with bill copy    2) In the box POCO has Mobile (Tempered glass pre installed), Charger, Transparent case cover and Manual.    3) Out of the box, visually the phone looks appealing. Rear camera placement and design choice looks good on the phone.    4a) To touch and feel, the rear of the phone feels more like plastic but at the same time it also feels rigid and non slippery cause of the design texture the material offers.    4b) For a big battery it carries, it doesn't look or feel very heavy.    5) Side mount finger print sensor/lock button. Well though out and rightly placed.    6) The device boots faster than QC SD665 device. Android 10 along with 6GB ram makes it smooth and agile, Storage option of 128GB is preferably better considering MIUI pre installed apps take up some space.    7) Smooth FHD Display worth the money. Phone offers additional display options like more warmth / cool / colour saturation as well.    8) Experiencing fast charging 1st hand. Battery charging and backup is Overwhelming! Yet to put through rigorous games.    9) Camera is average. Auto white balance is poor. Exposure is always on the bright side. Needs manual tweeking.    10) Stereo speakers are better than most other phones. Not crisp though.    11) For stock android users this MIUI may not be the best UI experience. Can be customised to personal preference.    12) Privacy wise MI pre installed apps allow most permission as default and disabling app permissions selectively is a time consuming job. Not all of them can be uninstalled.    Have to see how it handles with time.  Best value for money phone out there right now.",8 months ago,278,1390

71,"realme Narzo 50A (Oxygen Blue, 128 GB)",In*************,4,Good choice,Positive sides :  1. Battery is very very powerful. Certainly exceeds your expectations.  2. performance wise this phone is a very good purchase . smoothly functioning ..no lag..no heating issue.  3. Day light pic quality is above average. Selfie camera good.  4. There is dedicated slot for memory card apart from slots for 2 sim cards.    Negative sides :  1. Both rear and front camera in low light disappointing.  2. Display could have been Full HD+ instead of HD+. Realme has disappointed its customers here. Those who have already accustomed to mobiles with Full HD+/Amoled display surely gonna get disappointed here.    Overall its a good purchase considering its price range.

Display is also good for the price which one is paying.  No lags whatsoever though I haven't tried any high graphics games on this one.

Cons:  × If you think of doing gaming on this device, my advice would be go for POCO M3, M2 reloaded or Some Narzo device as the gaming mode is Missing and the processor isn't that strong enough to handle these smoothly.  ×It's a720p display so don't expect much colour accuracy or higher brightness.  ×Camera struggles indoors, selfie quality Not that good also.  × No type C and fast charging  Buy this considering above options.",1 month ago,264,792

If you are a hardcore Gamer in this price range Helio G95 is great not excellent but it is to expected.  Pros:  *If you are a normal user this phone can last more than 19 hrs a day.  *If you are a hardcore Gamer you could get at least 7-8 hrs which is great.  *If you want to use less battery you could try dark mode because it has amoled display.  *Ram management is great.  *OS is great and has so much features like floating window,split screen,multi user,dual channel acceleration,etc ...  *it's 30w dart charging is really great it would charge 0-100 in less than 65 min's.  *Display is really great colours are excellent.  *Camera app is great,you can shoot 4k/30fps.  *Selfie camera is amazing.  *If you are a hardcore Gamer you can play COD in high graphics to max frame rates there was no lag or shutters or frame drops.  *Multi media experience is great but if it had stereo speakers it would have been excellent.  *In-display fingerprint scanner is awesome    Cons:  *Camera is not upto the mark it's not good as expected,images turns out great in good lighting conditions but in night it sucks but it has night mode but still it's average, when you zoom you can understand that it is very less detailed even In good lighting conditions.",4 months ago,20,100

Chipset : SD860 is doing it's work. Amazing performance. Can't even imagine how did they brought a flagship chip into this price range.🤯    Camera : Good camera for this price range.    Display : Amoled display would have been great still 120hz is smooth although there's lack of depth in colours and when this mobile was tested with OP NORD aside, not looking great though.    Software : I think that's the only think I'm disappointed with. Using ONEPLUS for a while and taking this one in hand completely feel bizarre.    Stereo Speakers are pretty loud and good.    On a whole, best phone for this range. Worth buying. I won't regret this even after 2-3 years. Awesome 👍🏻🔥    Just go for it💯",7 months ago,6460,32300
434,"POCO X3 Pro (Steel Blue, 128 GB)",Ro*********,5,Fabulous!,"Nice phone at this price segment, 🚴三 fast and snapy    Just missing Super AMOLED display, else it's super",6 months ago,4404,22020
435,"POCO X3 Pro (Steel Blue, 128 GB)",Ay*****************,5,Just wow!,"Those who are gonna buy this X3P knows very much about pros n cons of the device, I will not waste your n mine time in writing it. Instead I will share my experience of past 1 week with this X3P.  1> First of all I want to clarify that don't compare this device to redmi note 10 series... Both the phones are targeted to different audience.    2> DISPLAY, I would say it's very nice display regarding the price at which you get it with SD860.  Yeah I missed the deeper blacks and punchier colours of an amoled display as my previous phone was Samsung Galaxy S7. But still I will call it a very nice IPS display, 120hz is bonus.    3> WEIGHT n DESIGN, yes it's a heavy phone but not that much heavy as people are saying, within 1to2 days you will get comfortable if your hands are not that small. Also, weight distribution is good, I am using it without cover.  Design wise it's okay, I will not call it good because I don't like this big Poco branding. Also, they should have gone with full matte back battery cover because glossy part is fingerprint magnet.    4> GAMING n PERFORMANCE, you know about this guys. X3P can handle 60fps in all games without overheating except Genshine Impact.  Yes, there is no overheating in the device until unless you are pushing your device to run at very high graphics with high fps or you have switched off the fans of your room.  Regarding performance you know what SD860 is capable of. One thing I like to mention that SD860 handles 120hz display with ease, you will find no stutters while using 120hz as phones with SD732 stutters.  Also, miui feels very smooth on this.    5> CAMERA n SPEAKERS, if you don't care about the details in the captured pictures you will find no difference with clicks of Redmi note 10 pro max.  Yes, both camera performs very similar, RN10Pmax has that detail advantage with its camera.  If your usage is limited upto WA/Twitter/Insta/FB uploads you will not be disappointed.  Well Poco should have given that IMX682(vanilla X3) instead of this IMX582.  Dual stereo Speakers on this X3P is very good and audio balance is also good, you will not find any sound difference between earpiece speaker and bottom speaker. Yes, Back panel have vibrations but I will not call it as a con, at least for me because vibrations at back give more immersive experience to me and gives a little bit bass experience also.  You can eliminate those back vibrations by choosing mono audio in accessibility option.  Output through headphones are also very good.    VERDICT-> Those who have bought the device including me also knows the compromises they have made i.e an amoled display and a glass sandwich design.  If you are okay to sacrifice these two things, I am damn sure you're gonna love this X3P.  Well it's a known fact that Xiaomi gives the best device for every price point in the market, with worst UI😅. Yes MiUi is feature rich but also have many bugs.  Presently I don't find any bugs in miui 12.0.4 which comes with this device, hope this bugless experience continues with the next upcoming updates also🤞.    One last thing I want to say regarding the flipkart services, delivery was on time and packaging was also good.  But flipkart is running scam regarding exchange of the phone specially during the sale days. I ordered the X3P with exchange offer, the offer was to exchange any smartphone with no damaged screen but body dent was acceptable. Usually delivery boy deffer the price the of the phone if there is any dent found on the phone which has to be exchanged, but in my case delivery boy simply rejected the exchange which was against the offer. I was totally disappointed with this.  I wanted to give bad rating, but it was flipkart's fault not the seller or the device. So gave genuine rating for the product.  I will again update my experience after 3 months when miui 12.5 will arrive.  Hope you find my experience useful🤞👍",5 months ago,2148,10740
436,"POCO X3 Pro (Steel Blue, 128 GB)",Ma***********,5,Must buy!,"I will share my review after using this for more than 15 days  The product is what you expect  The performance is amazing but the only thing which is not good is miui 12 i hope that the next miui version will fix the minor lag which is only due to nonoptimized software.  The camera is not that bad you will get a decent picture with enough details and i don't think that i can really differentiate between the 64 mp realme camera and this poco camera so go for it also you can easily use gcam which will further increase the camera performance.  Battery performance is amazing and so the charging speed it can charge your phone to from 0 to 50-60% in just 20-25 minutes also full charge requires 70 to 75 minutes.  Display is decent, brightness is the only thing which this phone lacks.  120hz is butter smooth and you will rarely feel any lag unlike other 120hz phone with normal processor like 720g 732g or dimensity 800u so here you can enjoy real 120hz display.  Speaker quality is awesome and so is the microphone.  So you can easily go for this device because this processor will compete the mid range processor for atleast 3 to 4 years but if you buy the mid range processor phone like 720g or 732g than after a year or two the phone will disappoint you and you will feel to change the mobile so i will suggest just go for this device.

437,"POCO X3 Pro (Steel Blue, 128 GB)",Ve************,5,Fabulous!,Simply awesome device. Performance of this mobile is mind blowing. I'm playing pubg in Ultra HD with extreme smoothness. And I have seen in most of the reviews that the camera quality was bad. So that attaching the photos that I captured on my mobile Poco X3 Pro. So that you can decide whether it is good or bad.  You feels like that you're in a mini theatre with these loud stereo speakers. Mobile design also looking good other than in the website or app. And it's display was very very very smooth in 120hz. But it drains the battery very quickly.,5 months ago,1174,5870

My honest review about the phone 😊after using for 1 week.    Performance is top notched due 2 Qualcom SD860 Chipset in this price segment no doubt.  Battery backup also works good & lasts for a day even if we use continuously by playing games, watching videos,etc.  Camera is average not up to the point.  LCD display is good but not up to the point it should have an amoled display.  Charging Speed is slow it almost takes 1 hr 20 min to full charge from 0 - 100%  Sound quality is superb due 2 dual stereo speakers but it vibrates the back panel when on full sound which irritates me the most.  Phone build quality is good & we hve gorilla glass 6 protection so its good.  It's a 4g device keep tht on mind.    Overall a good phone u can go for it but u hve to compromise on some things like vibration on back panel while full sound, display is dull in sunlight, camera is average, etc other thn 3 problems all is well & fantastic 😁👍.",6 months ago,1338,5352

Little bit warmer while charging but managable. No heating issues while gaming and regular task. Good cameras. No lags in normal operation. Better go for 6 gb version since OS uses lots of ram. Display brightness is excellent. No flickering issues. All sensors are working fine. It has dual band wifi both 2.4ghz and 5ghz. I am getting 195mpbs on 5ghz for 200 Mbps plan. Carrier aggregation is there for jio in Chennai. Call quality is good and has decent hear piece. Has volte and vowifi support. Has widevine L1 support and plays full hd content in both prime and Netflix. Fast charger charges from 0 to 100 in about 1 hr and 10 mins. Audio quality in wired headphone is also good. No adds but contains some junks which can be un installed.    My only concern with this phone is the video quality. Not as expected. It has HDR10 support. But while playing HDR content in youtube it white washes everything. Colours are not exact. Sometimes video lags. For normal hd content it is good. For prime video, Netflix, hotstar video quality is better. Hope realme soon fixes this with an update.    You can go for this phone if display is not your primary.

489,"SAMSUNG Galaxy F12 (Sea Green, 64 GB)",Ga**********,1,Hated it!,"The phone looks great in appearance. Fully black tinted glass pops out its nex gen looks. See Green gives compliment with whole black display. Precisely it is teal color not sea green. Touch (scroll up and down or sideways) is very smooth. Battery lasted from 24 Hours on 50% on mediocre use. Wi Fi connects fast and working nicely.    Now with cons (there are multiple)  Display is very very bad. It is smoky white rather than bright white. Colors are very dull.  There is over brightness on display specially when you play the video and compare it side by side.  Color correction is uneven. Yellow becomes pale yellow, Orange becomes dark yellow. Red becomes Maroon, Blue becomes Indigo and so on when compared with other phone side by side video. Overly faded colors.  I have 5 year old Mi Note 4 and this Samsung F12 lags far behind in terms of display quality.  I tried playing 2k video, and guess what file not supported then I used MX player, video played but was lagging too much such as 10 or 15 FPS. My Note 4 plays smoothly on default player.  Camera is pretty average, there is nothing Feb in it. May be because of smoky white display.  Touch (Tap) response is slow, takes time to open any app even settings.  Presently battery plugged in 60% charged and 1 hour 15 minutes remaining.    For me it is a BIG no. I would rather stick to my old phone.  Can't Believe Samsung was beaten by Redmi. China wins the round over South Korea for 5 years.    Changed ratings to 1 because Flipkart denied of any replacement or refund request very rudely.",6 months ago,1040,1040

Little bit warmer while charging but managable. No heating issues while gaming and regular task. Good cameras. No lags in normal operation. Better go for 6 gb version since OS uses lots of ram. Display brightness is excellent. No flickering issues. All sensors are working fine. It has dual band wifi both 2.4ghz and 5ghz. I am getting 195mpbs on 5ghz for 200 Mbps plan. Carrier aggregation is there for jio in Chennai. Call quality is good and has decent hear piece. Has volte and vowifi support. Has widevine L1 support and plays full hd content in both prime and Netflix. Fast charger charges from 0 to 100 in about 1 hr and 10 mins. Audio quality in wired headphone is also good. No adds but contains some junks which can be un installed.    My only concern with this phone is the video quality. Not as expected. It has HDR10 support. But while playing HDR content in youtube it white washes everything. Colours are not exact. Sometimes video lags. For normal hd content it is good. For prime video, Netflix, hotstar video quality is better. Hope realme soon fixes this with an update.    You can go for this phone if display is not your primary.

It is smoky white rather than bright white. Colors are very dull.  There is over brightness on display specially when you play the video and compare it side by side.  Color correction is uneven. Yellow becomes pale yellow, Orange becomes dark yellow. Red becomes Maroon, Blue becomes Indigo and so on when compared with other phone side by side video. Overly faded colors.  I have 5 year old Mi Note 4 and this Samsung F12 lags far behind in terms of display quality.  I tried playing 2k video, and guess what file not supported then I used MX player, video played but was lagging too much such as 10 or 15 FPS. My Note 4 plays smoothly on default player.  Camera is pretty average, there is nothing Feb in it. May be because of smoky white display.  Touch (Tap) response is slow, takes time to open any app even settings.  Presently battery plugged in 60% charged and 1 hour 15 minutes remaining.    For me it is a BIG no. I would rather stick to my old phone.  Can't Believe Samsung was beaten by Redmi. China wins the round over South Korea for 5 years.    Changed ratings to 1 because Flipkart denied of any replacement or refund request very rudely.",6 months ago,1040,1040

Battery backup is just ok means, normally u can use 1 day but if you are a gaming guy or want more battery life then u don't buy.    Amoled Display is best I give 5/5    Performance is good but as compare to mi note 8 pro-Helio g90t processor is good and faster than this realme 8 Helio g95 processor.    Now let's talk about features as compared to MI phones...  mi phones give more features as compared to realme.  In realme phones if you want to record a voice call then it's alert you and another caller person, says  ""This call is now been recorded"".  Realme company used 3rd parties apps google app like the calendar, notes, contacts, message app, files. This is not good. But in Mi phones, these features are given by Xiaomi and that is better and easy to handle and use.  A feature that clears the cache and deletes unnecessary data is not available in this realme phone if you want to clear then you have to download 3rd parties application.

STABILIZATION , THE PHONE SUPPORTS EIS , ULTRA STEADY MODE , ULTRA STUDY MAX MODE , BUT IT DOESNT WORK WELL , THE NORMAL VIDEO MODE WORKS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE UIS , UIS MAX MODE .

Battery backup is just ok means, normally u can use 1 day but if you are a gaming guy or want more battery life then u don't buy.    Amoled Display is best I give 5/5    Performance is good but as compare to mi note 8 pro-Helio g90t processor is good and faster than this realme 8 Helio g95 processor.    Now let's talk about features as compared to MI phones...  mi phones give more features as compared to realme.  In realme phones if you want to record a voice call then it's alert you and another caller person, says  ""This call is now been recorded"".  Realme company used 3rd parties apps google app like the calendar, notes, contacts, message app, files. This is not good. But in Mi phones, these features are given by Xiaomi and that is better and easy to handle and use.  A feature that clears the cache and deletes unnecessary data is not available in this realme phone if you want to clear then you have to download 3rd parties application.  When I use the phone for 2,3 hours then it heats a little bit  And the hotspot turns off automatically.",4 months ago,24,96

Gorgeous display, stunning new blue colour, excellent camera, best hardware-software combination, that’s how I would describe iPhone 12 as a package. 😊    Even though my previous iPhone had a 5.5” display and this one has 6.1” display, its overall body size is much smaller. Had to get used to it initially 🙂    Opening/closing/loading of apps is fast. No issues there. Video playback on this screen looks gorgeous. Took the 128GB variant, just so that i don’t have to backup to PC too often.    Battery lasts a day, it drains a bit faster on weekdays when I use its Mobile hotspot for office work. No connectivity issues though.    Few pics attached. Night shots look much better on iPhone 12.    No charging brick in the box. But works with my old iPhones charger/cable. I still ordered 20W fast charging brick separately from Apple site though. And it does charge pretty fast.    Flipkart delivery: Had done pre booking on the day they made it available on Flipkart. Awesome discount and old phone buy back offered. Had initial promised delivery date of 1st Nov, but got delivered on 4th Nov. Am not complaining though as I still got it prior to 6-9th Nov delivery that Apple’s own website was showing for this blue coloured 128GB variant 😆 Flipkart packaging uses no plastic 👍👍",11 months ago,6032,30160

Awesome! 👏🏽    Nokia is the best in dumb phone category, period. Of course its also getting great in the smartphone category as I am writing this review with Nokia 8.    what's in the box-  1. Handset  2. Battery  3. Charger  4. Manual    whats best-  1. Built quality. Very sturdy, very minimilist, very durable.  2. Just a phone- no camera, no gimmicks, its only for those who simply need a phone. Easy to operate. Speed dials, short cuts and all. I needed a single sim phone and this is the best in the range.period.  3. Battery- Nokia is known for its good battery life for a reason and its a truth. Charge lasts for a week. No Bluetooth, no WiFi, no internet, battery life enhanced.  4. Call quality- Using Airtel 3g, quality is dope. We live in area where signal isn't very reliable, but it works great even in bad weather.  5. Has FM radio which you can use with headphones. FMs can be very good in bad weather as it can give you important information regarding the rain storm if there's no electricity.    What I didn't like-  The box in which the phone came looked old.    verdict  If you simply need a phone to make calls with good connectivity, call quality and easy to operate UI, single sim, then go for this without any thought.","Jun, 2018",261,1305

As this phone is game centric, but doesn't mean one should play games only. Generic user can use that power to finish daily tasks quicker + 800 series survive longer than mid segment SoC's due to premium cores and materials used. Cameras are good not that bad but don't expect much. Attached some pictures before complete switch.    I have switched from Poco F1 to X3 Pro. So, similar balance with good upgrades.

919,"POCO X3 Pro (Steel Blue, 128 GB)",Ab************,4,Good quality product,"Honest Review:    I have been using this device for almost a month now. Here are things I want to share with you    Pros:  ->Superb Performance, 860 or I must say an over-clocked version of 855+ (855+ was released 2 years from now,  Marketing strategy: OP)  ->120 Hz display makes it super smooth  ->Speakers are loud, good for gamers stereo speakers are present.  ->Battery Backup is good  ->Liquid cooling is decent.    Cons:  ->Frames drop is rare but it happens.  ->If someone is saying that this phone does not have any heating issues, they will be lying.  ->The temperature shoots up within the first 5-10 mins of gaming. But the liquid cooling is decent enough to maintain and get it below 45(while gaming)  ->The temperature can reach above 50 degrees:  ->while charging(even you're not using the phone) I have seen this for the first 15 mins, then it gets back to normal(weird right?)  ->while playing games like COC (like seriously?)  ->After playing the game, the phone behaves quite weirdly  ->Display is okay, don't even compare with AMOLED (AMOLED displays are far far far better than IPS LCD panel).  ->Build quality is cheap, even mobiles under 15k have better build quality. The back panel vibrates while playing music.    Lastly,  If you want a phone with a good camera, don't buy it, don't believe those YouTubers who say its camera is decent, the front camera is bad to be honest.",6 months ago,107,428

Decent camera, great looks, great battery and charging.    Design:Looks great and classy due to gorilla glass at back. camera bump is slightly bigger but this issue can fixed by using cover. Phone is slightly bigger.    Display:It has 6.67inch ips lcs display. Viewing angles are good has Decent brightness. There is screen bleeding around camera cutout and edges of display but not a big deal every lcd djisplay has screen bleeding and can be solved by using dark mode.    Camera:Forget about megapixels it has Decent camera. back camera is good video quality is also good u can record video in 4k. macro camera is great.  But front camera is not that great I don't know why it makes faces yellowish. hope it will be resolved in future updates.    Battery and charging: Best in this price segment can be used for 2 days in normal usage. It takes 1:20-25 min to full charge,above 58%in 30 min,85%in 1 hour. For me it's battery and charger was deal breaker.    Performance:it has Snapdragon's 720g. Great performance. But I saw some lags in the UI which can be solved in future updates. I didn't played pubg but I played some games no heating issue at all.    Speaker: nice speaker. Vocals are clear and has Decent loudness    Final verdict: I think it's best phone in this price point. U can opt this over realme 6 only realme 6's camera is better than this.    Deducted one star due to its privacy issues. Clean master is still there.    Hope it is helpfull. Press like button if it is.    Adding some pics for better insight.","Aug, 2020",533,2132

The application's run smoothly without any lags, call quality is too good in this model and the battery backup is awesome. Few things like wide-angle lens, higher watt charger and OLED display are missing but with this pricing we cannot expect features of a premium phones. Processor is Dimensity 700U, it does the job perfectly. Realme has used a higher quality display and it does the job at its best, the auto brightness works excellently during the outdoor and indoor conditions. Anyone who is planning to buy a 5g ready smartphone (Depends upon the band release) like me for longer duration can go for this handset. I have always used stock android mobile phones, I was bit worried about the UI experience while purchasing Narzo 30 5g but I am fully satisfied with the UI experience since Realme has made it very close to the stock android. The build quality is also good. This is my first Realme mobile and I should say it worth the money I have invested. Thank you!",4 months ago,738,3690

1122,"realme GT Master Edition (Cosmos Black, 128 GB)",Mo************,4,Delightful,Detailed Review. I would compare to Oppo Reno 6  1. When it comes to look and feel This phone is very good but not even close to Oppo reno 6. Reno 6 is just amazing when I first saw and held it in my hand that phone gives you another level of look and feel. So this is good but not as good as reno 6. I would highly recommend please check the reno in showrooms just to have a look.  2. Camera. The camera is okay I wouldn't complain much. But yes there are some good camera phones in this price range. I didn't like the basic camera I have installed GCAM and now the camera looks good. The camera could have been better.  3. Charging. charging is really fast and the battery lasts a day. Gives you a screen time of close to 7 hours. This is a good advantage of this phone.  4. Headphone jack gives an edge. Phone is very compact so very easy to use.  5. Flipkart messed the delivery part and delayed it by 2 days.  6. I got a lot of calls from scammers they have all my details. Phone no. and everything they even knew product is delay and asking for more and debit card details. Someone in Flipkart sharing the data with scammers so guys are aware of that  7. Still using it is just 3 days I would edit and give you more details later.,1 month ago,374,1496

Pros  Front Camera is above average  Rear camera is too god.  Fast charging is phenomenal. Charges the phone in 30 min.  Display is better than that of MI 11x  Touch is butter smooth.  Night mode is 🔥  The processor doesn't seems underpowered. I played COD at highest settings and did not notice any frame drops and heating.      Cons.  I didn't find any serious cons yet.  The phone gets little warm while charging because of very fast charging. Atleast it doesn't blast like nord 2.  Doesn't have OIS but has EIS.,1 month ago,24,120

1126,"realme GT Master Edition (Cosmos Black, 128 GB)",As**********,4,Very Good,"Writing this review after using this mobile for 6 days  This is not a value for money phone, I rued after I bought it, Realme x7 max was priced around 21k on offer.    Camera  Performs okay in daylight, in night time it sucks badly, too many noise in the photos. You expect a much better camera. 3/5    Display  A good one you will not be disappointed. 4/5    Battery  A big issue for me, the hype of 0-100 within 35 minutes is a stratagem, you can't (will not) carry that 65w charger to your office or University. The battery drains fast, I have to charge this 2 times a day. 3/5    Performance    Top notch until now, buttery smooth 4/5    BGMI    Smooth + Extreme gives you a perfect faming experience enhanced by its gt mode. 4/5    ** Mono speaker sounds great, realme should have gone for stereo though. Overall my reaction is mixed. My advice will be not to buy this, even if you want to, better wait for few months for the stiff price drop like x7 max.",1 month ago,21,84

Camera is neither the best nor the worst, it's quite good for this price point.  6000 mA battery 🔋👍🏻  Though it comes with a lot of bloatware but you can just uninstall most of them (excluding system apps)  Finally the Verdict is that it's a good budget smartphone",8 months ago,5103,25515

1159,"POCO M3 (Cool Blue, 64 GB)",Sa********,5,Best in the market!,"1) Delivery on time, Properly packed with bill copy    2) In the box POCO has Mobile (Tempered glass pre installed), Charger, Transparent case cover and Manual.    3) Out of the box, visually the phone looks appealing. Rear camera placement and design choice looks good on the phone.    4a) To touch and feel, the rear of the phone feels more like plastic but at the same time it also feels rigid and non slippery cause of the design texture the material offers.    4b) For a big battery it carries, it doesn't look or feel very heavy.    5) Side mount finger print sensor/lock button. Well though out and rightly placed.    6) The device boots faster than QC SD665 device. Android 10 along with 6GB ram makes it smooth and agile, Storage option of 128GB is preferably better considering MIUI pre installed apps take up some space.    7) Smooth FHD Display worth the money. Phone offers additional display options like more warmth / cool / colour saturation as well.    8) Experiencing fast charging 1st hand. Battery charging and backup is Overwhelming! Yet to put through rigorous games.    9) Camera is average. Auto white balance is poor. Exposure is always on the bright side. Needs manual tweeking.    10) Stereo speakers are better than most other phones. Not crisp though.    11) For stock android users this MIUI may not be the best UI experience. Can be customised to personal preference.    12) Privacy wise MI pre installed apps allow most permission as default and disabling app permissions selectively is a time consuming job. Not all of them can be uninstalled.    Have to see how it handles with time.  Best value for money phone out there right now.",8 months ago,278,1390

Screen touch at the keyboard, sometimes not responsive  5. Sound from Dual speaker not up to the mark, low audible  6. Battery is feels like it is 5000 mah  7. Back cover is good designed by poco  8.

Gorgeous display, stunning new blue colour, excellent camera, best hardware-software combination, that’s how I would describe iPhone 12 as a package. 😊    Even though my previous iPhone had a 5.5” display and this one has 6.1” display, its overall body size is much smaller. Had to get used to it initially 🙂    Opening/closing/loading of apps is fast. No issues there. Video playback on this screen looks gorgeous. Took the 128GB variant, just so that i don’t have to backup to PC too often.    Battery lasts a day, it drains a bit faster on weekdays when I use its Mobile hotspot for office work. No connectivity issues though.    Few pics attached. Night shots look much better on iPhone 12.    No charging brick in the box. But works with my old iPhones charger/cable. I still ordered 20W fast charging brick separately from Apple site though. And it does charge pretty fast.    Flipkart delivery: Had done pre booking on the day they made it available on Flipkart. Awesome discount and old phone buy back offered. Had initial promised delivery date of 1st Nov, but got delivered on 4th Nov. Am not complaining though as I still got it prior to 6-9th Nov delivery that Apple’s own website was showing for this blue coloured 128GB variant 😆 Flipkart packaging uses no plastic 👍👍",11 months ago,6032,30160

I don't why, some device at this price or below are offering android 10. While the time of writing this review android 11 betas are also out and still oppo is strucked with Android 9. I will write a review later if any updates come  * Front Camera is below average for indoor lighting conditions.    Overall:  * For this price range it's not bad, offering decent specs.  * If you are not a geeky, photographic, gamer then you can buy this","Jun, 2020",658,3290

1324,"APPLE iPhone 12 (Blue, 128 GB)",Ke***********,5,Just wow!,"iPhone 6S Plus 64GB -> iPhone 12 128GB  My 2nd iPhone, upgraded after 5 years.    Gorgeous display, stunning new blue colour, excellent camera, best hardware-software combination, that’s how I would describe iPhone 12 as a package. 😊    Even though my previous iPhone had a 5.5” display and this one has 6.1” display, its overall body size is much smaller. Had to get used to it initially 🙂    Opening/closing/loading of apps is fast. No issues there. Video playback on this screen looks gorgeous. Took the 128GB variant, just so that i don’t have to backup to PC too often.    Battery lasts a day, it drains a bit faster on weekdays when I use its Mobile hotspot for office work. No connectivity issues though.    Few pics attached. Night shots look much better on iPhone 12.    No charging brick in the box. But works with my old iPhones charger/cable. I still ordered 20W fast charging brick separately from Apple site though. And it does charge pretty fast.    Flipkart delivery: Had done pre booking on the day they made it available on Flipkart. Awesome discount and old phone buy back offered. Had initial promised delivery date of 1st Nov, but got delivered on 4th Nov. Am not complaining though as I still got it prior to 6-9th Nov delivery that Apple’s own website was showing for this blue coloured 128GB variant 😆 Flipkart packaging uses no plastic 👍👍",11 months ago,6032,30160

1415,"MOTOROLA G40 Fusion (Frosted Champagne, 128 GB)",Sa***********,5,Perfect product! Better than Redmi Note 10 pro & Realme 7,"This is my first moto phone.. writing this detailed review after a week time of usage. New details covered here for your better understanding.    Currently i'm having realme 7 (8gb+128gb) which was bought 7 months back. Realme 7 is good in features but phone call quality , bluetooth call quality is not good and somewhat i'm not satisfied with that phone. Redmi Note 10 pro also was in list but heard that lot of display issues, hanging, bloatware and inferior quality. Hence i decided to go with this Moto G40.    Moto G40 pros :-  1) Screen size is little bigger which is good but not really needed for everyone  2) Screen quality is same like Realme 7 , no worries about the quality  3) Clean OS, interesting moto gestures  4) Lot of optimization than realme 7 (even both phones are having android 11)  5) Call quality is great, signal strength is good, VOLTE calls are good  6) Bluetooth & wi-fi connectivity is also good  7) Interestingly the weight seems lesser than Realme 7 (tried 2 phones in differnt hands, moto feels lighter than realme)  8) Phone thickness is of both moto & realme is same, so no more bulky feel  9) Camera quality is awesome when comparing with Realme 7. Many people are saying camera is normal in reviews. those people may have not changed the settings. I tried to take pictures simultaneously in Realme 7 & moto G40, realme captured less details and moto g40 captured details than realme. color is natural in moto , realme 7 is over saturated. Moto g40 is the clear winner than realme7.  10) Battery life is as like as Realme 7, not seen any difference. withstanding for 1 full day without games. you can optimize the battery, fine tune app usage details, change refresh rates to extend the battery life  11) 6gb+128gb of moto is charm than 8gb+128gb of realme  12) Build quality is good & sturdy.  13) Sound quality is decent. no complaint.  14) No heat      General:-  * Tried to charge with 30watts Dart charger of Realme 7 , but moto phone charged like normal and turbo charger mode is not enabled  * Turbo mode enabled after connected the supplied moto charger. so there is NO support of other branded fast charger  * I liked backside finger sensor option (my previous honor 8 pro is also having back finger print sensor). Side finger sensor is not convenient in Realme 7, screen unlocking frequently while holding the mobile in hand. so, i'm okay with back sensor.      Cons:-  1) the supplied transparent case is having sharp outer edges and irritating while attending calls  2) Seller delayed the shipment and Flipkart delivery was pathetic this time. Anwyhow this is not related with product  3) 30watts / 60 watts fast charger is preferable at this price  not found any other issue.    Conclusion:-  This is better than Realme 7, Redmi Note 10 pro and other similar models. Trusted brand, super build quality, nice battery and good weight balance. camera quality is also very good at this price. You can go ahead with this model without any hesitation.",5 months ago,151,755
1416,"MOTOROLA G40 Fusion (Frosted Champagne, 128 GB)",Pr************,4,Very Good,"I'll give a detailed review after using the phone for a week.    Pros :-  1. Big 6000mAh battery  2. Ad and bloatware free near-stock Android OS with the latest update  3. Customisable user friendly UI  4. Nice clear camera (I'm not a camera person but I liked both the front and rear cameras and the options which we have in the camera app)    Cons :-  1. For those who haven't used big screens like me, getting used to this screen will take a while.  2. Moto promised an upgrade till Android 12 but they didn't comment about anything after that. They need to be clear about that like other brands like Samsung, Nokia, etc.)    Didn't find any other cons after that.  After all this, I think it's a good phone.",5 months ago,492,1968

1423,"MOTOROLA G40 Fusion (Frosted Champagne, 128 GB)",An**********,5,Worth every penny,"Adding this comment after 4 days of heavy use  First thing to mention is the battery backup. Lasted for 3 days without gaming.    Camera is good enough and is stable. If you're looking for a better camera, go for G60, has the same specs but 108mp camera. Rest is the same    Speakers are working nice at high volumes and have a good pitch to it.    Ui is stock android 11 with latest updates installed. It is pretty smooth and free of bloatware which is not the case with poco and mi phones. But if you're from the background of any of the above 2, (like I am), you'll find some useful features absent here,, like floating window, blurring aap in task manager preview mode and others fancy things. But life can go on without these hassle-free anyways.    Phone is little bulky when compared to others but that shouldn't be concerning as we always use heavy back covers. Screen is very big, so if you're looking for a big screen (people with big hands will find this phone appealing) go for it.  Screen refresh rate is 120heartz, which is unusual at this price range. Really feels smooth and fluid.    Only con is that the battery capacity is 6000mah and to charge a massive battery like this, motorola should have provided atleast a 33 watt charger instead of 20watt.  And yes, a notification light would have been a nice add-on :)    Overall: low budget, maximum battery, good performance and a big screen with smooth stock ui. I guess that's all you need for day to day work.",5 months ago,21,105

I got it for my father  wanted a phone that could last 3 years  clean and smooth experience  didnt want to get into hastle of bugs as simple as proximity sensor  miui looks and feels in these budget device is bad and updates has been crippling devices after a year(couldn't go with redmi note 10pro)    At the end it all depends on users  And moto is for different types of users who care about user experience        UPDATE 2:  Short review after 3 months of usage  A major bug is fixed  The cameras are improved  focus hunting issue in video fixed  GCAM support is great  Display is smoother and touch response improved and gaming has been improved with bgmi 90fps through configs",5 months ago,23,115

1477,"realme GT Master Edition (Luna White, 128 GB)",Mo************,4,Delightful,Detailed Review. I would compare to Oppo Reno 6  1. When it comes to look and feel This phone is very good but not even close to Oppo reno 6. Reno 6 is just amazing when I first saw and held it in my hand that phone gives you another level of look and feel. So this is good but not as good as reno 6. I would highly recommend please check the reno in showrooms just to have a look.  2. Camera. The camera is okay I wouldn't complain much. But yes there are some good camera phones in this price range. I didn't like the basic camera I have installed GCAM and now the camera looks good. The camera could have been better.  3. Charging. charging is really fast and the battery lasts a day. Gives you a screen time of close to 7 hours. This is a good advantage of this phone.  4. Headphone jack gives an edge. Phone is very compact so very easy to use.  5. Flipkart messed the delivery part and delayed it by 2 days.  6. I got a lot of calls from scammers they have all my details. Phone no. and everything they even knew product is delay and asking for more and debit card details. Someone in Flipkart sharing the data with scammers so guys are aware of that  7. Still using it is just 3 days I would edit and give you more details later.,1 month ago,374,1496
1478,"realme GT Master Edition (Luna White, 128 GB)",Fl***************,5,Best in the market!,This is one of the best phone in this price range.    Pros  Front Camera is above average  Rear camera is too god.  Fast charging is phenomenal. Charges the phone in 30 min.  Display is better than that of MI 11x  Touch is butter smooth.  Night mode is 🔥  The processor doesn't seems underpowered. I played COD at highest settings and did not notice any frame drops and heating.      Cons.  I didn't find any serious cons yet.  The phone gets little warm while charging because of very fast charging. Atleast it doesn't blast like nord 2.  Doesn't have OIS but has EIS.,1 month ago,24,120

1481,"realme GT Master Edition (Luna White, 128 GB)",As**********,4,Very Good,"Writing this review after using this mobile for 6 days  This is not a value for money phone, I rued after I bought it, Realme x7 max was priced around 21k on offer.    Camera  Performs okay in daylight, in night time it sucks badly, too many noise in the photos. You expect a much better camera. 3/5    Display  A good one you will not be disappointed. 4/5    Battery  A big issue for me, the hype of 0-100 within 35 minutes is a stratagem, you can't (will not) carry that 65w charger to your office or University. The battery drains fast, I have to charge this 2 times a day. 3/5    Performance    Top notch until now, buttery smooth 4/5    BGMI    Smooth + Extreme gives you a perfect faming experience enhanced by its gt mode. 4/5    ** Mono speaker sounds great, realme should have gone for stereo though. Overall my reaction is mixed. My advice will be not to buy this, even if you want to, better wait for few months for the stiff price drop like x7 max.",1 month ago,21,84

There could have been improvements with the adaptive charging, 25 or 30 W would've been better, but it really doesn't matter because one charge is enough to last you for more than one day at a stretch. The visual quality is absolutely amazing and the side-mounted fingerprint scanner delivers just what it promised, its really instant.

The screen is of good quality, even though its not amoled, the colours are good. so there are no compromises in terms of display.  2. In my brief usage, the battery is good enough.  3. Cameras are good for this price.  4. Stock android, one of the major reasons for buying it. Also the moto app is good enough for customization.  5. Speakers are loud enough.    6. Weight distribution is done really well but my fingers started to pain after using it for a few mins. I used redmi note 8 which is just 30g lighter. Maybe I will get used to it in a day or two.  7. The phone is thicker as well compared to redmi note8 but I dont have any problem with the thickness.  8. Charging takes a bit of time but im okay with it considering the capacity.  9. The default notification sound is annoying, had to change it.    Moto is owned by lenovo which is chinese but all of our data is stored in USA where the headquarters are situated. Also the phone is made in India as far as I know. So it's a better option compared to other companies like Redmi or Realme.",5 months ago,588,2940

Nd even comparing this model with the other smartphones offer by the Chinese company like oppo-vivo-redmi-realme is not that much fair as Lava is an Indian company which don't have that much financial support like those companies. Yet by this model it is clear that the company is trying very hard to compete with the others. Although no one will deny that their is a large scope of improvement specially in the software.    Hardware is pretty gud. Except the processor they must go for the chipset of Qualcomm or MediaTek that will improve the performance in much better way.

Prospective buyers can then decide    1. For photo and video enthusiasts. Very reliable camera. Fast and excellent picture quality. Videos are absolutely stable and professional quality. You would be amazed how many people shoot Youtube videos on an iPhone. The only downside is that the display doesn’t do justice to the photos and videos you have taken. Night photos are also not that great but if you get Neural cam app for 400 bucks its well worth it.    2. Very reliable performance. No lag whatsoever. All major apps work better than android counterparts. Internet connection is also more stable. It functions exactly how a smartphone should be.    3. Its fun when you have more apple devices. I have an iPad and airdrop is an amazing feature    4. For those who don’t want to lug a heavy oversized phone in your pocket and but needs all that high end power in a compact form, this phone is the perfect choice.    5. For those who don’t play heavy games and media consumption is moderate. Isn’t that how life supposed to be? More living and less glued to your phone? This is one of the main reasons I switched to this phone. Reduce your big screen and media consumption addiction.    6. If you are okay with charging every night after a day of moderate usage.

Cons: 1) The major disadvantage in using this Phone I found in the Battery, As Apple has given an official statement of having ""13 hrs of video playback on full charged"" is not true as Battery get drained within 4 hrs of usage, so if you are using a phone for longer duration don't go for this phone.    2) Screen Size 4.7"" seems to be very short as per the cost of the phone. It could be at least 5.3"".    3) Iphone SE has an Heating problem, I don't whether this issue is encountered in every Iphone or not, but in my Phone it is there & phone gets heated very badly in sudden. while having on video call , gaming or while charging.    4) Hotspot is taking atleast 8 to 10 min while connecting it to other systems Wifi or laptop Wifi which is another major cons I observed.","May, 2020",130,390

1626,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Purple, 64 GB)",Va************,5,Excellent Phone! Read My Review.,"If you're in the market for a compact phone with probably the best cameras in a phone today, that does not sacrifice on performance or any of the flagship features then your decision must start and end with an iPhone. First of all Apple has created something that is a throwback to the best smartphones ever designed - the iphone 5 and 5S. While doing so Apple made sure that it did not compromise on power or performance. The 12 mini has all the features (ALL OF THEM!) of the bigger iPhone 12 - so basically its the same A14 processor, same cameras, same RAM, same OLED screen, same FaceID, same wireless charging, same water resistance, same 5G support and everything else! Except that this is a smaller sized phone physically, which is so comfortable to hold that you'll wonder what happened to the smartphone industry getting obsessed over making bigger devices every year.    Fun fact : Literally 8 years ago in 2013 was when the iPhone 5S was announced. That was considered the gold standard in smartphone design. In 8 years we're carrying phones that are getting so uncomfortably big we have forgotten to use them with one hand. You know what's really funny? Human hands have stayed the same size in the last 8 years too. :D    You're not reading this for fun facts. You're really reading this review wondering if the battery life suffers because of the smaller battery on the mini compared to the regular sized iPhone 12. The simple answer - NOT REALLY!. Let me explain. Compared to the regular sized iPhone 12 - you will get ~1.5 hours less in terms of 100% - fully dead battery for the same level of usage on both phones. You can verify this via several YouTube channels that have tested this extensively. So basically for ~1.5 to 2 hours less battery life you get a phone that is so compact, without sacrificing anything else in terms of features. For me personally this means that I love my iPhone 12 mini. Convenience over 2 extra hours of battery life anyday for me. Plus I got a 20W fast charger that charges my mini from 10% - 100% in about ~45 minutes. My phone charges on Apple Carplay while I'm driving too. So 2 less hours of battery life is overrated for me. But you may disagree and that's fine.    Final verdict : If ~1.5 to 2 hours of extra battery backup along with a slightly bigger screen means more for you and how you want to use your phone, buy the regular sized iPhone 12. But for 2 hours less battery backup you prefer the convenience of carrying around a smaller, lighter phone that has everything that the regular 12 has, then buy the 12 mini without a doubt! This is a question of your priorities. ALSO if you're wondering if suddenly typing on a smaller screen will become an issue coming from a bigger phone, you could not be more wrong! It took me all of only 3 hours to get used to typing on this screen. Just FYI - I switched to this from a OnePlus 7T so I'm really speaking the truth. :D We tend to underestimate the ability of our brain and fingers on how quickly we can adapt to change. :D",7 months ago,511,2555
1627,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Purple, 64 GB)",Na******************,4,Nice product,"As per my usage I think the battery is adequate as I don’t often use my phone and at the end of the as per my usage the battery percentage remains at 40% but if you are a heavy user then you might feel the drain. The screen is small and typing might be an issue but after few minutes on you’ll get used to it, the camera and the screen are awesome and the picture quality superb as per my liking. I would recommend a screen protector as minor scratches may occur, which might be caused while cleaning the dust off the phone etc. The price you are paying for a relatively small phone might give you a thought but it’s worth every penny. Light and durable phone and the shape reminds of the older IPhones the 5 & 5s for me which was the best designed iPhone ever regardless of the size",10 months ago,691,2764

This phone is best if you are non gamer and use your phone just for movies,YouTube video's etc.  Good as well for operating social network apps.    Camera  Good photos with an average HDR.  Photos are quite bright  Even the front camera is more clear    Battery  I feel the best part of this phone is the battery,it's long lasting and gives the best performance.  This battery is also 4500-5000 mah range so...it will never let you down on battery capacity    Performance  Performance is an average and quite could have been better but yes at this price range it's like more than enough 😂. honestly    I have gifted this phone to my Mom and she is loving it 😍  I hope my selection will let her down.

Writing this review after a week    Pros:  * Supports portable Hotspot for both bands bands 2.5 ghz and 5ghz  * Good battery life lasts for 1.5 days for normal usage(like WhatsApp, instagram)  * Brought the blue color variant, it's stunning when compared to the black color variant  * Has support for dual 4g volte  * Color os 6 one of the easy to use smart UI  * Back camera has 5x zoom, could take some good macroshot depending upon the lighting  * Cellular reception is also good    Cons:  * It's still running on color os 6.x based on android 9 pie out of the box. I don't why, some device at this price or below are offering android 10. While the time of writing this review android 11 betas are also out and still oppo is strucked with Android 9. I will write a review later if any updates come  * Front Camera is below average for indoor lighting conditions.    Overall:  * For this price range it's not bad, offering decent specs.  * If you are not a geeky, photographic, gamer then you can buy this","Jun, 2020",658,3290

I would give you my honest experience..  I will talk only about the Lacunas/cons of this phone,  1.Battery-it lasts only for 24 hrs by general use,(like phone call, YouTube, whatsup video call) without gaming, while gaming it's battery drains fastly, for charging it takes 1.21 hrs.  2.Camera-As it is 48 MP, I personally did not find anything like 48 MP, rather samsung M30 has better quality of pics than this 48 MP, Night mode is not good enough,Its just a hipe,clarity has to be compromised,  Even front camera is not good, pics get blurr by zoom. Same here samsung M30 again have gain..  So camera is not as good as they told., blur and shaggy images, I have really disappointed.  3.Display- kindly go for super Amoled display, if you compare FHD of Poco M2 pro and sAmoled of samsung you will really feel the difference,  4.Gaming has heating problem,battery drains fastly,  5.weight is something I feel heavy, hard to use by single hand.  6.sound is average,  So it's my honest feedback after using it for 10 days. I really feel disappointed.(camera, display)  Now other things like processor, interface,speed, design, finger print sensor are best.  Thanks 👍","Aug, 2020",4066,20330

Display is good..  I appreciate this phone because of still using headphone jack.  Hats off to dedicated slot..  I I'll give 1star for the camera of this phone....  Come on we don't need macro sensor ...for this you can give main camera in sony sensor with aperture lower than 1.6..  Look out these photos...these are clicked by Redmi note 7 pro...

But this phone doesn't have internet access. It's a basic day to day call and messaging device.  Build quality is good as advertised.  Device itself is small and slim, easily fits in the hand.  Charging port is normal USB type and not C type, but does the job. Charger provided inside box is really good.  Camera is the only down side but one should not look for camera performance in this range. This is not for camera enthusiasts.  Ringing is loud and should not be hard to hear, but it feels like it could have been louder.  People like me who are trying to lessen smart phone usage (digital well-being) can opt for this device.  Overall this phone is nostalgia packed inside a basic phone.",8 months ago,341,1364

1703,LAVA Flip,So*************,3,Decent product,Cutting two stars for pathetic delivery. Delivery man was so bad. I can't even describe how he bothered. And this happened very first time. Otherwise product is very good.    Pros first:  1. very good looking phone  2. Battery backup is very good.  3. Some preloded timepass game.  4. Phone looks classy and stylish.  5. Flip gives very comfortable talking experience    Now cons:  1. Would be better if had a dual display  2. Phone is bit overpriced. 1200-1300 would be a great deal  3. At least internet connectivity they should have given.  4 There is no any option of turning off Blinking lights.  5. Camera is bad. At least 2 MP they should have given,9 months ago,69,207

Gorgeous display, stunning new blue colour, excellent camera, best hardware-software combination, that’s how I would describe iPhone 12 as a package. 😊    Even though my previous iPhone had a 5.5” display and this one has 6.1” display, its overall body size is much smaller. Had to get used to it initially 🙂    Opening/closing/loading of apps is fast. No issues there. Video playback on this screen looks gorgeous. Took the 128GB variant, just so that i don’t have to backup to PC too often.    Battery lasts a day, it drains a bit faster on weekdays when I use its Mobile hotspot for office work. No connectivity issues though.    Few pics attached. Night shots look much better on iPhone 12.    No charging brick in the box. But works with my old iPhones charger/cable. I still ordered 20W fast charging brick separately from Apple site though. And it does charge pretty fast.    Flipkart delivery: Had done pre booking on the day they made it available on Flipkart. Awesome discount and old phone buy back offered. Had initial promised delivery date of 1st Nov, but got delivered on 4th Nov. Am not complaining though as I still got it prior to 6-9th Nov delivery that Apple’s own website was showing for this blue coloured 128GB variant 😆 Flipkart packaging uses no plastic 👍👍",11 months ago,6032,30160

Decent camera, great looks, great battery and charging.    Design:Looks great and classy due to gorilla glass at back. camera bump is slightly bigger but this issue can fixed by using cover. Phone is slightly bigger.    Display:It has 6.67inch ips lcs display. Viewing angles are good has Decent brightness. There is screen bleeding around camera cutout and edges of display but not a big deal every lcd djisplay has screen bleeding and can be solved by using dark mode.    Camera:Forget about megapixels it has Decent camera. back camera is good video quality is also good u can record video in 4k. macro camera is great.  But front camera is not that great I don't know why it makes faces yellowish. hope it will be resolved in future updates.    Battery and charging: Best in this price segment can be used for 2 days in normal usage. It takes 1:20-25 min to full charge,above 58%in 30 min,85%in 1 hour. For me it's battery and charger was deal breaker.    Performance:it has Snapdragon's 720g. Great performance. But I saw some lags in the UI which can be solved in future updates. I didn't played pubg but I played some games no heating issue at all.    Speaker: nice speaker. Vocals are clear and has Decent loudness    Final verdict: I think it's best phone in this price point. U can opt this over realme 6 only realme 6's camera is better than this.    Deducted one star due to its privacy issues. Clean master is still there.    Hope it is helpfull.

1764,KARBONN Jumbo K9,ar*************,4,gud phone,"I ordered my karbonn k9 on 16th and it was dispatched the very next day.. they gave me a list of service centres near my place too.. hats off to flipkart service.    about the phone: a low cost beauty.    pros:  dirt cheap rate.  recharger wire clubs as a data-cable, so no need to buy it separately.  large screen, splendid display.  led torch is an added luxury  pretty good battery life.  os is pretty user friendly.  music player is real loud, sounds terrific on headphones/speakers.  music player/ video players support all common formats.  messaging is easy.  supports upto 16gb microsd.    cons:  good display goes unused as video player lacks video quality.  the player rejects some files, dont know why, prob as they are above 15mb.  battery size is 1800mh, which burns ur pocket if a replacement is required.. costs about 500rs.  music sound is loud, but not really pleasing to keep it going. a headset is recommended.  photo viewer rejects files above 450 kb size.  keypad looks fragile.  the phone could probably hang up if memory slot is overloaded.  the camera is a namesake one, but it could turn out handy    The reason i opted for this phone is that i wanted a low cost phone for my use till end of next year  when im slated to get an android. and i think this model is just too perfect for my situation.  a 1.8k phone with all possible features i could probably need, including gprs.  nokia handsets offering the same features would have cost me atleast 4k, which is more than two k9s.    in all, im happy with its performance. its not the best out there, but probably the best for such a cheap rate.  perfect if u want something of everything(features) for cheap.  the body is simple and neat, luks gud at a glance. rating: 4/5.","Nov, 2011",118,472
1765,KARBONN Jumbo K9,Sa*********,5,The Best Value for Money Phone!,"Great features for a such a price range!  Thanks Flipkart for the awesome service!

The dual LED torchlight works wonders(very powerful!)  Games are Pacman,Snake  You can individually Password lock phonebook,messages,call history,file manager.  And last but not the least, Battery life!  When i received the phone the batter was half in the indicator, I used it for 4.5 days without charging( i played music,vids, used the camera etc during these days and etc)  Exceptionally Good Battery life!

1766,KARBONN Jumbo K9,Ro*******,3,Jumbo memory and Jumbo battery..YES! But poor build!,"For a phone that retails at this price point, the Jumbo K9 is a decent buy. After using it for 2 weeks, I thought I should put in words what I think about this Karbonn product.    Pros:  1. Good large screen for this budget, easy to the eye.  2. Really good battery back-up (main reason for me having this phone)..easily lasts 4-5 days with average multimedia usage.  3. Decent calling capabilities, though voice does seem unclear sometimes from the other end.  4. One-touch calling (a plus point for a dual-SIM phone).  5. Memory storage capacity (16 GB!).  6. Dual-active SIM!  7. Fast and responsive OS, no lag noticed.  8. WAP is very decent....good for checking e-mails on the go.    Cons:  1. The loudspeaker is very mediocre..songs do not 'sound' good at all...definitely need a good pair of headphone to hear music!  2. Keypad is small, not for people who chat a lot using SMS (not a big issue for me though as I am an infrequent 'messager')!  3. The video player and image viewer rejects some files on criteria that are not known to the user (some large files play, some don't! some mp4/avi files play, while some don't!).  4. No data cable, so to remove the memory card every time, you have to remove the battery as well!  5. The camera is plain poor...really of no use...and definitely not a 1.3 MP camera as claimed by the manufacturer...should not have been here...would've been a few bucks cheaper!  6. Really poor built and is fragile (so handle with care); the screen too is a dust/finger-print magnet!    All in all, if you are a frequent traveler and need a dual-active SIM phone mainly for calling purpose with a good battery back-up and storage capability...and are willing to 'care' for it at a very reasonable price, go for Jumbo K9...that's precisely why I got it. :-)","Jul, 2012",48,144

1776,"realme GT Master Edition (Voyager Grey, 128 GB)",Mo************,4,Delightful,Detailed Review. I would compare to Oppo Reno 6  1. When it comes to look and feel This phone is very good but not even close to Oppo reno 6. Reno 6 is just amazing when I first saw and held it in my hand that phone gives you another level of look and feel. So this is good but not as good as reno 6. I would highly recommend please check the reno in showrooms just to have a look.  2. Camera. The camera is okay I wouldn't complain much. But yes there are some good camera phones in this price range. I didn't like the basic camera I have installed GCAM and now the camera looks good. The camera could have been better.  3. Charging. charging is really fast and the battery lasts a day. Gives you a screen time of close to 7 hours. This is a good advantage of this phone.  4. Headphone jack gives an edge. Phone is very compact so very easy to use.  5. Flipkart messed the delivery part and delayed it by 2 days.  6. I got a lot of calls from scammers they have all my details. Phone no. and everything they even knew product is delay and asking for more and debit card details. Someone in Flipkart sharing the data with scammers so guys are aware of that  7. Still using it is just 3 days I would edit and give you more details later.,1 month ago,374,1496

Pros  Front Camera is above average  Rear camera is too god.  Fast charging is phenomenal. Charges the phone in 30 min.  Display is better than that of MI 11x  Touch is butter smooth.  Night mode is 🔥  The processor doesn't seems underpowered. I played COD at highest settings and did not notice any frame drops and heating.      Cons.  I didn't find any serious cons yet.

Camera  Performs okay in daylight, in night time it sucks badly, too many noise in the photos. You expect a much better camera. 3/5    Display  A good one you will not be disappointed. 4/5    Battery  A big issue for me, the hype of 0-100 within 35 minutes is a stratagem, you can't (will not) carry that 65w charger to your office or University. The battery drains fast, I have to charge this 2 times a day. 3/5    Performance    Top notch until now, buttery smooth 4/5    BGMI    Smooth + Extreme gives you a perfect faming experience enhanced by its gt mode. 4/5    ** Mono speaker sounds great, realme should have gone for stereo though.

Prospective buyers can then decide    1. For photo and video enthusiasts. Very reliable camera. Fast and excellent picture quality. Videos are absolutely stable and professional quality. You would be amazed how many people shoot Youtube videos on an iPhone. The only downside is that the display doesn’t do justice to the photos and videos you have taken. Night photos are also not that great but if you get Neural cam app for 400 bucks its well worth it.    2. Very reliable performance. No lag whatsoever. All major apps work better than android counterparts. Internet connection is also more stable. It functions exactly how a smartphone should be.    3. Its fun when you have more apple devices. I have an iPad and airdrop is an amazing feature    4. For those who don’t want to lug a heavy oversized phone in your pocket and but needs all that high end power in a compact form, this phone is the perfect choice.    5. For those who don’t play heavy games and media consumption is moderate. Isn’t that how life supposed to be? More living and less glued to your phone? This is one of the main reasons I switched to this phone. Reduce your big screen and media consumption addiction.    6. If you are okay with charging every night after a day of moderate usage.    Its just a phone. There are much more important things in your life. Don’t waste too much time on this.    Thank you for reading.","Aug, 2020",1019,5095

Cons: 1) The major disadvantage in using this Phone I found in the Battery, As Apple has given an official statement of having ""13 hrs of video playback on full charged"" is not true as Battery get drained within 4 hrs of usage, so if you are using a phone for longer duration don't go for this phone.    2) Screen Size 4.7"" seems to be very short as per the cost of the phone. It could be at least 5.3"".    3) Iphone SE has an Heating problem, I don't whether this issue is encountered in every Iphone or not, but in my Phone it is there & phone gets heated very badly in sudden. while having on video call , gaming or while charging.    4) Hotspot is taking atleast 8 to 10 min while connecting it to other systems Wifi or laptop Wifi which is another major cons I observed.","May, 2020",130,390

Took the 128GB variant, just so that i don’t have to backup to PC too often.    Battery lasts a day, it drains a bit faster on weekdays when I use its Mobile hotspot for office work. No connectivity issues though.    Few pics attached. Night shots look much better on iPhone 12.    No charging brick in the box. But works with my old iPhones charger/cable. I still ordered 20W fast charging brick separately from Apple site though. And it does charge pretty fast.    Flipkart delivery: Had done pre booking on the day they made it available on Flipkart.

1857,"POCO M3 Pro 5G (Cool Blue, 64 GB)",SH*******,5,Highly recommended,"It is a good budget 5G phone. I loved it. Good performance is giving out from dimensity 700🔥🔥.  The mediatek dimensity 700 give a performance equalent to Snapdragon 732G in gaming. Almost the two processor Antu Antu score is almost equal.But one of disadvantages of mediatek is game optimization is less compared to Snapdragon. In future the app developer of games will fix this issue. My complete review is down here👇      1.👉 Good performance at this price range  2. 👉Good battery backup it last more than one day. I got screen on time upto 10hrs  3.👉90hz display is good and it is very smooth. It's automatically dynamic refresh rate switching features is very good, we don't have to change manually in settings while gaming.  4. 👉360 degree proximity sensor is very good.  5. 👉5G connectivity, is very good. Almost all 5G band are offering in mediatek dimensity 700. In dimensity 800U not all bands available which is in the dimensity 700.  6.👉18w fast charging is there, it take maximum 2hrs to full charge. But my suggestion is that they have to include 33W fast charging like in poco m2 pro. Due to 5G, they don't provide that😭.  7.👉The Poco M3 Pro has a high-res main camera. It relies on a 48MP OmniVision OV48B 1/2"" sensor with 0.8µm pixels, Quad-Bayer filter and PDAF. The lens is 26mm f/1.8. Night Mode is available on this imager.  The macro camera uses a 2MP Hynix Hi-259 sensor with large 1.75µm pixels. The lens is f/2.4, while the focus is fixed at about 4cm-5cm distance.    The third shooter at the back is a 2MP GalaxyCore GC02M1B monochrome depth sensor.    The selfie camera uses an 8MP OmniVision OV8856 1/4"" sensor with 1.12µm pixels. It sits behind an f/2.0 lens, and the focus is fixed.  8.👉 It offers UFS 2.2 storage which is 10 times better than UFS 2.1.  9.👉 The mobile phone is design is very attractive and stylish 🔥😍😍  10.👉 Dual tone flashlight is very good feature.

1883,Nokia 216 DS,Ha***************,4,Delightful,"So here's my review of Nokia 216 DS HMD Global.  So first thing on box is the manufacturing date  which is August 2019.  Pros:  The front camera takes very good quality of selfies.  Rear camera with flash.  I am using Airtel Sim and yes the internet works.  Very good software for a feature phone.  It's Nokia 30+ series supports Facebook,MSN,Twitter,Notepad, Remainder,Weather.    Cons: No Snake game  No free games only demo games require payment for the full version.  Rs.50 INR per game.  You can download pirated games from Internet but I won't recommend that.    So if you are a selfie freak then buy Nokia 216  But if you are looking for better feature phones then go for Nokia 3310 or 8110 4G  If you think above listed feature are heavy for you then buy Nokia 150.    Note: The phone supports Avi and 3gp files for video playback mp4 is not supported.  I am not sure if any other formats for video playback are supported.  You can also change your wallpaper and ringtone.    Please wait I will be posting photos of my Nokia 216 soon.  Love You♥️","Sep, 2019",84,336

1901,Nokia 105,Aj**********,3,Not up to the mark.. Voice leakage is a concern,"As compared with the older classic phones this one disappoits me.    The Good  + Feels quite good to hold  + Body is well built  + Body is not scratchy since its matte finish  + The Nokia UI    The bad  - Voice leakage is a main concern. The phone has only one speaker which faces back side, So when you are talking you are actually hearing from the back side than front side which is quite irky. Also this makes things audible to ppl around well rather than you.    - The ringer volume is not really good like old phones. Plus the speaker holes are located facing back which further reduces volume if its lying back faced on a bed    - Display size- At first use you will feel its freaky tiny compared to any other phones. Its only 1.45 inch utilizing only a small part of the top region    - I don't think this is much an issue. But sometimes you accidentally hit the wrong arrow key since its rubbery and not clearly accurate. But the dial pad is really good. Only the arrow keys matter    - Lastly there's the Nokia life tools in the menu which is a crap for many and chances are there that people unknowingly hit that and you will lose your phone balance.    #reviewsbyajith","Nov, 2013",232,696

Best for the one who wants to spend time in relaxed manner, without fb, g+, videos, games and hefty internet usage. i feel, some or other time everyone will fall back to purchase basic phones to get rid of junk digital world.

1925,"POCO M2 Pro (Out of the Blue, 64 GB)",রা*********,5,Terrific,"Hi all,  As I have bought Poco M2 pro on first sale, I would like to share my review on this.  I would give you my honest experience..  I will talk only about the Lacunas/cons of this phone,  1.Battery-it lasts only for 24 hrs by general use,(like phone call, YouTube, whatsup video call) without gaming, while gaming it's battery drains fastly, for charging it takes 1.21 hrs.  2.Camera-As it is 48 MP, I personally did not find anything like 48 MP, rather samsung M30 has better quality of pics than this 48 MP, Night mode is not good enough,Its just a hipe,clarity has to be compromised,  Even front camera is not good, pics get blurr by zoom. Same here samsung M30 again have gain..  So camera is not as good as they told., blur and shaggy images, I have really disappointed.  3.Display- kindly go for super Amoled display, if you compare FHD of Poco M2 pro and sAmoled of samsung you will really feel the difference,  4.Gaming has heating problem,battery drains fastly,  5.weight is something I feel heavy, hard to use by single hand.  6.sound is average,  So it's my honest feedback after using it for 10 days. I really feel disappointed.(camera, display)  Now other things like processor, interface,speed, design, finger print sensor are best.  Thanks 👍","Aug, 2020",4066,20330

One who is looking for best camera then you should not buy this..though it has a samsung isocell camera sensor..it struggles a lot while focusing...Redmi note 7 pro even came with sony sensor...then i don't know why the upcoming phones are coming with samsung sensor  While coming to the battery part...it gives a excellent battery backup..Screen On time would be 9.5hrs max .  Display is good..  I appreciate this phone because of still using headphone jack.  Hats off to dedicated slot..  I I'll give 1star for the camera of this phone....  Come on we don't need macro sensor ...for this you can give main camera in sony sensor with aperture lower than 1.6..  Look out these photos...these are clicked by Redmi note 7 pro...

The camera lacks details or sharpness and the saturation of each photos you take looks unnatural. My old Redmi note 7 pro takes better pictures than this.

2032,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Black, 64 GB)",Va************,5,Excellent Phone! Read My Review.,"If you're in the market for a compact phone with probably the best cameras in a phone today, that does not sacrifice on performance or any of the flagship features then your decision must start and end with an iPhone. First of all Apple has created something that is a throwback to the best smartphones ever designed - the iphone 5 and 5S. While doing so Apple made sure that it did not compromise on power or performance. The 12 mini has all the features (ALL OF THEM!) of the bigger iPhone 12 - so basically its the same A14 processor, same cameras, same RAM, same OLED screen, same FaceID, same wireless charging, same water resistance, same 5G support and everything else! Except that this is a smaller sized phone physically, which is so comfortable to hold that you'll wonder what happened to the smartphone industry getting obsessed over making bigger devices every year.    Fun fact : Literally 8 years ago in 2013 was when the iPhone 5S was announced. That was considered the gold standard in smartphone design. In 8 years we're carrying phones that are getting so uncomfortably big we have forgotten to use them with one hand. You know what's really funny? Human hands have stayed the same size in the last 8 years too. :D    You're not reading this for fun facts. You're really reading this review wondering if the battery life suffers because of the smaller battery on the mini compared to the regular sized iPhone 12. The simple answer - NOT REALLY!. Let me explain. Compared to the regular sized iPhone 12 - you will get ~1.5 hours less in terms of 100% - fully dead battery for the same level of usage on both phones. You can verify this via several YouTube channels that have tested this extensively. So basically for ~1.5 to 2 hours less battery life you get a phone that is so compact, without sacrificing anything else in terms of features. For me personally this means that I love my iPhone 12 mini. Convenience over 2 extra hours of battery life anyday for me. Plus I got a 20W fast charger that charges my mini from 10% - 100% in about ~45 minutes. My phone charges on Apple Carplay while I'm driving too. So 2 less hours of battery life is overrated for me. But you may disagree and that's fine.    Final verdict : If ~1.5 to 2 hours of extra battery backup along with a slightly bigger screen means more for you and how you want to use your phone, buy the regular sized iPhone 12. But for 2 hours less battery backup you prefer the convenience of carrying around a smaller, lighter phone that has everything that the regular 12 has, then buy the 12 mini without a doubt! This is a question of your priorities. ALSO if you're wondering if suddenly typing on a smaller screen will become an issue coming from a bigger phone, you could not be more wrong! It took me all of only 3 hours to get used to typing on this screen. Just FYI - I switched to this from a OnePlus 7T so I'm really speaking the truth. :D We tend to underestimate the ability of our brain and fingers on how quickly we can adapt to change. :D",7 months ago,511,2555
2033,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Black, 64 GB)",Na******************,4,Nice product,"As per my usage I think the battery is adequate as I don’t often use my phone and at the end of the as per my usage the battery percentage remains at 40% but if you are a heavy user then you might feel the drain. The screen is small and typing might be an issue but after few minutes on you’ll get used to it, the camera and the screen are awesome and the picture quality superb as per my liking. I would recommend a screen protector as minor scratches may occur, which might be caused while cleaning the dust off the phone etc. The price you are paying for a relatively small phone might give you a thought but it’s worth every penny. Light and durable phone and the shape reminds of the older IPhones the 5 & 5s for me which was the best designed iPhone ever regardless of the size",10 months ago,691,2764

2035,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Black, 64 GB)",Vi*******,1,Waste of money!,"Brilliant processor with a tiny battery.    Pro: This phone has the fastest processor in the world.  Con: With a tiny battery & small screen they aren’t pretty useful.    Pro: Supports Dolby Vision HDR Video recording and playback  Con: once you export the video to laptop or pendrive to watch it in big screen, dolby vision disappears from the video and it gets converted to SD. This defeats the whole purpose of having a dolby vision recording facility    Pro: low light photography is really good  Con: Photos no longer look natural. There’s some color correction happening and that makes the photo looks warmer.    Verdict: I purchased this phone considering the pocket friendly size of the phone and A14 chip. It was later I realised that with the tiny battery the phone actually throttles the cpu power. Hence I don’t see any magic happening while editing photos or videos. Export/Rendering time is same as that of iPhone 7 Plus.",6 months ago,196,196

2112,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (White, 64 GB)",Va************,5,Excellent Phone! Read My Review.,"If you're in the market for a compact phone with probably the best cameras in a phone today, that does not sacrifice on performance or any of the flagship features then your decision must start and end with an iPhone. First of all Apple has created something that is a throwback to the best smartphones ever designed - the iphone 5 and 5S. While doing so Apple made sure that it did not compromise on power or performance. The 12 mini has all the features (ALL OF THEM!) of the bigger iPhone 12 - so basically its the same A14 processor, same cameras, same RAM, same OLED screen, same FaceID, same wireless charging, same water resistance, same 5G support and everything else! Except that this is a smaller sized phone physically, which is so comfortable to hold that you'll wonder what happened to the smartphone industry getting obsessed over making bigger devices every year.    Fun fact : Literally 8 years ago in 2013 was when the iPhone 5S was announced. That was considered the gold standard in smartphone design. In 8 years we're carrying phones that are getting so uncomfortably big we have forgotten to use them with one hand. You know what's really funny? Human hands have stayed the same size in the last 8 years too. :D    You're not reading this for fun facts. You're really reading this review wondering if the battery life suffers because of the smaller battery on the mini compared to the regular sized iPhone 12. The simple answer - NOT REALLY!. Let me explain. Compared to the regular sized iPhone 12 - you will get ~1.5 hours less in terms of 100% - fully dead battery for the same level of usage on both phones. You can verify this via several YouTube channels that have tested this extensively. So basically for ~1.5 to 2 hours less battery life you get a phone that is so compact, without sacrificing anything else in terms of features. For me personally this means that I love my iPhone 12 mini. Convenience over 2 extra hours of battery life anyday for me. Plus I got a 20W fast charger that charges my mini from 10% - 100% in about ~45 minutes. My phone charges on Apple Carplay while I'm driving too. So 2 less hours of battery life is overrated for me. But you may disagree and that's fine.    Final verdict : If ~1.5 to 2 hours of extra battery backup along with a slightly bigger screen means more for you and how you want to use your phone, buy the regular sized iPhone 12. But for 2 hours less battery backup you prefer the convenience of carrying around a smaller, lighter phone that has everything that the regular 12 has, then buy the 12 mini without a doubt! This is a question of your priorities. ALSO if you're wondering if suddenly typing on a smaller screen will become an issue coming from a bigger phone, you could not be more wrong! It took me all of only 3 hours to get used to typing on this screen. Just FYI - I switched to this from a OnePlus 7T so I'm really speaking the truth. :D We tend to underestimate the ability of our brain and fingers on how quickly we can adapt to change. :D",7 months ago,511,2555
2113,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (White, 64 GB)",Na******************,4,Nice product,"As per my usage I think the battery is adequate as I don’t often use my phone and at the end of the as per my usage the battery percentage remains at 40% but if you are a heavy user then you might feel the drain. The screen is small and typing might be an issue but after few minutes on you’ll get used to it, the camera and the screen are awesome and the picture quality superb as per my liking. I would recommend a screen protector as minor scratches may occur, which might be caused while cleaning the dust off the phone etc. The price you are paying for a relatively small phone might give you a thought but it’s worth every penny. Light and durable phone and the shape reminds of the older IPhones the 5 & 5s for me which was the best designed iPhone ever regardless of the size",10 months ago,691,2764

2115,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (White, 64 GB)",Vi*******,1,Waste of money!,"Brilliant processor with a tiny battery.    Pro: This phone has the fastest processor in the world.  Con: With a tiny battery & small screen they aren’t pretty useful.    Pro: Supports Dolby Vision HDR Video recording and playback  Con: once you export the video to laptop or pendrive to watch it in big screen, dolby vision disappears from the video and it gets converted to SD. This defeats the whole purpose of having a dolby vision recording facility    Pro: low light photography is really good  Con: Photos no longer look natural. There’s some color correction happening and that makes the photo looks warmer.    Verdict: I purchased this phone considering the pocket friendly size of the phone and A14 chip. It was later I realised that with the tiny battery the phone actually throttles the cpu power. Hence I don’t see any magic happening while editing photos or videos. Export/Rendering time is same as that of iPhone 7 Plus.",6 months ago,196,196

I would give you my honest experience..  I will talk only about the Lacunas/cons of this phone,  1.Battery-it lasts only for 24 hrs by general use,(like phone call, YouTube, whatsup video call) without gaming, while gaming it's battery drains fastly, for charging it takes 1.21 hrs.  2.Camera-As it is 48 MP, I personally did not find anything like 48 MP, rather samsung M30 has better quality of pics than this 48 MP, Night mode is not good enough,Its just a hipe,clarity has to be compromised,  Even front camera is not good, pics get blurr by zoom. Same here samsung M30 again have gain..  So camera is not as good as they told., blur and shaggy images, I have really disappointed.  3.Display- kindly go for super Amoled display, if you compare FHD of Poco M2 pro and sAmoled of samsung you will really feel the difference,  4.Gaming has heating problem,battery drains fastly,  5.weight is something I feel heavy, hard to use by single hand.  6.sound is average,  So it's my honest feedback after using it for 10 days. I really feel disappointed.(camera, display)  Now other things like processor, interface,speed, design, finger print sensor are best.  Thanks 👍","Aug, 2020",4066,20330

Display is good..  I appreciate this phone because of still using headphone jack.  Hats off to dedicated slot..  I I'll give 1star for the camera of this phone....

Gorgeous display, stunning new blue colour, excellent camera, best hardware-software combination, that’s how I would describe iPhone 12 as a package. 😊    Even though my previous iPhone had a 5.5” display and this one has 6.1” display, its overall body size is much smaller. Had to get used to it initially 🙂    Opening/closing/loading of apps is fast. No issues there. Video playback on this screen looks gorgeous. Took the 128GB variant, just so that i don’t have to backup to PC too often.    Battery lasts a day, it drains a bit faster on weekdays when I use its Mobile hotspot for office work. No connectivity issues though.    Few pics attached. Night shots look much better on iPhone 12.    No charging brick in the box. But works with my old iPhones charger/cable. I still ordered 20W fast charging brick separately from Apple site though. And it does charge pretty fast.    Flipkart delivery: Had done pre booking on the day they made it available on Flipkart. Awesome discount and old phone buy back offered. Had initial promised delivery date of 1st Nov, but got delivered on 4th Nov. Am not complaining though as I still got it prior to 6-9th Nov delivery that Apple’s own website was showing for this blue coloured 128GB variant 😆 Flipkart packaging uses no plastic 👍👍",11 months ago,6032,30160

2356,"realme GT NEO 2 (NEO Blue, 128 GB)",Su*****,5,Fabulous!,"Thank You FLIPKART ❣️  This is my genuine review after using the devices for 5 days.  Looks & Feels Very Premium. Got the sporty Neon green Colour.  A good quality case is also provided though it will more suited for black variant but it does the work for me until I get a new one.  Processor & Os - I have purchased 8GB/128GB variant, it has also got a 5GB dynamic RAM Expansion. It comes with a SD870 7nm processor which is very nice & the realme UI 2.0 runs like a charm. I encountered no hiccups at all while using the device...not a single one.  Screen & Audio - 120 GHz E4 AMOLED is very bright & punchy. Its the first realme device with HDR10+ certification. It doesn't come with a 3.5 mm jack but that's ok for me as I have barely used that in my previous mobile (It can be a negative point for hardcore gamers). It is a Aptx HD certified device & support HD wireless sound profile. I have watched 4k HDR 10bit videos with Atmos sound & the experience was amazing.  Camera - Camera is good but image processing was not good enough. You can click amazing pics in good lit condition but in low light conditions image came out to be grainy. Front cam is good. Images were little too saturated but finally the issue is sorted out with the latest software update & front cam pics are now awesome & I mean it. Use GCam.  Games - Though I rarely use mobile device for heavy gaming, but this device does surprised me. My initial gaming experience was good. Graphics were brilliant. Response was fast. I will update it later with long time review.  Software - Realme UI 2.0 is nice & there are lot of customisation options. It does comes with bloatware but you can get rid of most of it by simply uninstall or adb tools.  Battery - 5000mah battery does the work well & can easily last for a day with moderate usage & for high end gaming it will give U 6 hrs of SOT easily.  General Usage - Call quality is awsome just like any flagship device. 4G+ is supported. Does come with 8 band 5G profile but we have to wait for that. Wifi 6 is an added feature & U can connect to 2 Wifi connections at the same time for some apps supporting Dual acceleration. Typing in this device is a charm. Haptics are so good...& are optimised like a pro device.  My final Verdict - Go for it guys. This is a GT for a no Nonsense experience. Looking forward to Android 12 based Realme UI 3.0",17 days ago,24,120

2433,"REDMI Note 10S (Shadow Black, 128 GB)",Sh**************,4,Pretty good,"Since it's a Helio G95 powered phone, the phone heats a lot and I need to play games in a cool room. The first few minutes, I get 60 fps in battle royale games like CODM and PUBGM. But after a while, I get around 15 fps and major frame drops. The camera and display are both great. Same goes for fast charging. I use the phone all day on a single charge. If I game, it takes about 2 charges to last a day. Moving from SD450 to G95, so I'm actually happy.  Low light selfies aren't that great, but low light pictures on rear camera are excellent. Loving the great AMOLED display. It's a great phone, but might affect your gaming if you're from a humid place. Have a great day ahead. :3",2 months ago,741,2964

2479,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Black, 128 GB)",Va************,5,Excellent Phone! Read My Review.,"If you're in the market for a compact phone with probably the best cameras in a phone today, that does not sacrifice on performance or any of the flagship features then your decision must start and end with an iPhone. First of all Apple has created something that is a throwback to the best smartphones ever designed - the iphone 5 and 5S. While doing so Apple made sure that it did not compromise on power or performance. The 12 mini has all the features (ALL OF THEM!) of the bigger iPhone 12 - so basically its the same A14 processor, same cameras, same RAM, same OLED screen, same FaceID, same wireless charging, same water resistance, same 5G support and everything else! Except that this is a smaller sized phone physically, which is so comfortable to hold that you'll wonder what happened to the smartphone industry getting obsessed over making bigger devices every year.    Fun fact : Literally 8 years ago in 2013 was when the iPhone 5S was announced. That was considered the gold standard in smartphone design. In 8 years we're carrying phones that are getting so uncomfortably big we have forgotten to use them with one hand. You know what's really funny? Human hands have stayed the same size in the last 8 years too. :D    You're not reading this for fun facts. You're really reading this review wondering if the battery life suffers because of the smaller battery on the mini compared to the regular sized iPhone 12. The simple answer - NOT REALLY!. Let me explain. Compared to the regular sized iPhone 12 - you will get ~1.5 hours less in terms of 100% - fully dead battery for the same level of usage on both phones. You can verify this via several YouTube channels that have tested this extensively. So basically for ~1.5 to 2 hours less battery life you get a phone that is so compact, without sacrificing anything else in terms of features. For me personally this means that I love my iPhone 12 mini. Convenience over 2 extra hours of battery life anyday for me. Plus I got a 20W fast charger that charges my mini from 10% - 100% in about ~45 minutes. My phone charges on Apple Carplay while I'm driving too. So 2 less hours of battery life is overrated for me. But you may disagree and that's fine.    Final verdict : If ~1.5 to 2 hours of extra battery backup along with a slightly bigger screen means more for you and how you want to use your phone, buy the regular sized iPhone 12. But for 2 hours less battery backup you prefer the convenience of carrying around a smaller, lighter phone that has everything that the regular 12 has, then buy the 12 mini without a doubt! This is a question of your priorities. ALSO if you're wondering if suddenly typing on a smaller screen will become an issue coming from a bigger phone, you could not be more wrong! It took me all of only 3 hours to get used to typing on this screen. Just FYI - I switched to this from a OnePlus 7T so I'm really speaking the truth. :D We tend to underestimate the ability of our brain and fingers on how quickly we can adapt to change. :D",7 months ago,511,2555

Prospective buyers can then decide    1. For photo and video enthusiasts. Very reliable camera. Fast and excellent picture quality. Videos are absolutely stable and professional quality. You would be amazed how many people shoot Youtube videos on an iPhone. The only downside is that the display doesn’t do justice to the photos and videos you have taken. Night photos are also not that great but if you get Neural cam app for 400 bucks its well worth it.    2. Very reliable performance. No lag whatsoever. All major apps work better than android counterparts. Internet connection is also more stable. It functions exactly how a smartphone should be.    3. Its fun when you have more apple devices. I have an iPad and airdrop is an amazing feature    4. For those who don’t want to lug a heavy oversized phone in your pocket and but needs all that high end power in a compact form, this phone is the perfect choice.    5. For those who don’t play heavy games and media consumption is moderate. Isn’t that how life supposed to be? More living and less glued to your phone? This is one of the main reasons I switched to this phone. Reduce your big screen and media consumption addiction.    6. If you are okay with charging every night after a day of moderate usage.    Its just a phone. There are much more important things in your life. Don’t waste too much time on this.    Thank you for reading.","Aug, 2020",1019,5095

Cons: 1) The major disadvantage in using this Phone I found in the Battery, As Apple has given an official statement of having ""13 hrs of video playback on full charged"" is not true as Battery get drained within 4 hrs of usage, so if you are using a phone for longer duration don't go for this phone.    2) Screen Size 4.7"" seems to be very short as per the cost of the phone. It could be at least 5.3"".    3) Iphone SE has an Heating problem, I don't whether this issue is encountered in every Iphone or not, but in my Phone it is there & phone gets heated very badly in sudden. while having on video call , gaming or while charging.    4) Hotspot is taking atleast 8 to 10 min while connecting it to other systems Wifi or laptop Wifi which is another major cons I observed.","May, 2020",130,390

Read My Review.,"If you're in the market for a compact phone with probably the best cameras in a phone today, that does not sacrifice on performance or any of the flagship features then your decision must start and end with an iPhone. First of all Apple has created something that is a throwback to the best smartphones ever designed - the iphone 5 and 5S. While doing so Apple made sure that it did not compromise on power or performance. The 12 mini has all the features (ALL OF THEM!) of the bigger iPhone 12 - so basically its the same A14 processor, same cameras, same RAM, same OLED screen, same FaceID, same wireless charging, same water resistance, same 5G support and everything else! Except that this is a smaller sized phone physically, which is so comfortable to hold that you'll wonder what happened to the smartphone industry getting obsessed over making bigger devices every year.    Fun fact : Literally 8 years ago in 2013 was when the iPhone 5S was announced. That was considered the gold standard in smartphone design. In 8 years we're carrying phones that are getting so uncomfortably big we have forgotten to use them with one hand. You know what's really funny? Human hands have stayed the same size in the last 8 years too. :D    You're not reading this for fun facts.

Cheapest phone 📱 with 128gb and fingerprint unlock.  Lots of junk apps but fortunately most can be deleted.  Spam notification with ads are annoying giving it a cheap and trashy feel.  Dual wi-fi working compared to 9i which can't connect to 5ghz.  Gyroscope is better than redmi so it's easy to play any games that require tilting.  My theory is that redmi decided to save money and use some software gyroscope instead of hardware.  Processor is slow so games like real racing 3 drop frames even when compared to iPad 2 from 9 years ago.  Everything else seems fine in the first week of use.  Can't mute notifications directly like on redmi, you have to go through settings and the app which is a pain.  Ugly colour but was the only variant available and can be hidden with a back cover.

2599,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Red, 128 GB)",Va************,5,Excellent Phone! Read My Review.,"If you're in the market for a compact phone with probably the best cameras in a phone today, that does not sacrifice on performance or any of the flagship features then your decision must start and end with an iPhone. First of all Apple has created something that is a throwback to the best smartphones ever designed - the iphone 5 and 5S. While doing so Apple made sure that it did not compromise on power or performance. The 12 mini has all the features (ALL OF THEM!) of the bigger iPhone 12 - so basically its the same A14 processor, same cameras, same RAM, same OLED screen, same FaceID, same wireless charging, same water resistance, same 5G support and everything else! Except that this is a smaller sized phone physically, which is so comfortable to hold that you'll wonder what happened to the smartphone industry getting obsessed over making bigger devices every year.    Fun fact : Literally 8 years ago in 2013 was when the iPhone 5S was announced. That was considered the gold standard in smartphone design. In 8 years we're carrying phones that are getting so uncomfortably big we have forgotten to use them with one hand. You know what's really funny? Human hands have stayed the same size in the last 8 years too. :D    You're not reading this for fun facts. You're really reading this review wondering if the battery life suffers because of the smaller battery on the mini compared to the regular sized iPhone 12. The simple answer - NOT REALLY!. Let me explain. Compared to the regular sized iPhone 12 - you will get ~1.5 hours less in terms of 100% - fully dead battery for the same level of usage on both phones. You can verify this via several YouTube channels that have tested this extensively. So basically for ~1.5 to 2 hours less battery life you get a phone that is so compact, without sacrificing anything else in terms of features. For me personally this means that I love my iPhone 12 mini. Convenience over 2 extra hours of battery life anyday for me. Plus I got a 20W fast charger that charges my mini from 10% - 100% in about ~45 minutes. My phone charges on Apple Carplay while I'm driving too. So 2 less hours of battery life is overrated for me. But you may disagree and that's fine.    Final verdict : If ~1.5 to 2 hours of extra battery backup along with a slightly bigger screen means more for you and how you want to use your phone, buy the regular sized iPhone 12. But for 2 hours less battery backup you prefer the convenience of carrying around a smaller, lighter phone that has everything that the regular 12 has, then buy the 12 mini without a doubt! This is a question of your priorities. ALSO if you're wondering if suddenly typing on a smaller screen will become an issue coming from a bigger phone, you could not be more wrong! It took me all of only 3 hours to get used to typing on this screen. Just FYI - I switched to this from a OnePlus 7T so I'm really speaking the truth. :D We tend to underestimate the ability of our brain and fingers on how quickly we can adapt to change. :D",7 months ago,511,2555
2600,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Red, 128 GB)",Na******************,4,Nice product,"As per my usage I think the battery is adequate as I don’t often use my phone and at the end of the as per my usage the battery percentage remains at 40% but if you are a heavy user then you might feel the drain. The screen is small and typing might be an issue but after few minutes on you’ll get used to it, the camera and the screen are awesome and the picture quality superb as per my liking. I would recommend a screen protector as minor scratches may occur, which might be caused while cleaning the dust off the phone etc. The price you are paying for a relatively small phone might give you a thought but it’s worth every penny. Light and durable phone and the shape reminds of the older IPhones the 5 & 5s for me which was the best designed iPhone ever regardless of the size",10 months ago,691,2764

Let me explain. Compared to the regular sized iPhone 12 - you will get ~1.5 hours less in terms of 100% - fully dead battery for the same level of usage on both phones. You can verify this via several YouTube channels that have tested this extensively. So basically for ~1.5 to 2 hours less battery life you get a phone that is so compact, without sacrificing anything else in terms of features. For me personally this means that I love my iPhone 12 mini. Convenience over 2 extra hours of battery life anyday for me. Plus I got a 20W fast charger that charges my mini from 10% - 100% in about ~45 minutes. My phone charges on Apple Carplay while I'm driving too. So 2 less hours of battery life is overrated for me. But you may disagree and that's fine.    Final verdict : If ~1.5 to 2 hours of extra battery backup along with a slightly bigger screen means more for you and how you want to use your phone, buy the regular sized iPhone 12. But for 2 hours less battery backup you prefer the convenience of carrying around a smaller, lighter phone that has everything that the regular 12 has, then buy the 12 mini without a doubt! This is a question of your priorities. ALSO if you're wondering if suddenly typing on a smaller screen will become an issue coming from a bigger phone, you could not be more wrong! It took me all of only 3 hours to get used to typing on this screen. Just FYI - I switched to this from a OnePlus 7T so I'm really speaking the truth. :D We tend to underestimate the ability of our brain and fingers on how quickly we can adapt to change. :D",7 months ago,511,2555
2620,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Purple, 128 GB)",Na******************,4,Nice product,"As per my usage I think the battery is adequate as I don’t often use my phone and at the end of the as per my usage the battery percentage remains at 40% but if you are a heavy user then you might feel the drain. The screen is small and typing might be an issue but after few minutes on you’ll get used to it, the camera and the screen are awesome and the picture quality superb as per my liking. I would recommend a screen protector as minor scratches may occur, which might be caused while cleaning the dust off the phone etc. The price you are paying for a relatively small phone might give you a thought but it’s worth every penny. Light and durable phone and the shape reminds of the older IPhones the 5 & 5s for me which was the best designed iPhone ever regardless of the size",10 months ago,691,2764

2622,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Purple, 128 GB)",Vi*******,1,Waste of money!,"Brilliant processor with a tiny battery.    Pro: This phone has the fastest processor in the world.  Con: With a tiny battery & small screen they aren’t pretty useful.    Pro: Supports Dolby Vision HDR Video recording and playback  Con: once you export the video to laptop or pendrive to watch it in big screen, dolby vision disappears from the video and it gets converted to SD. This defeats the whole purpose of having a dolby vision recording facility    Pro: low light photography is really good  Con: Photos no longer look natural. There’s some color correction happening and that makes the photo looks warmer.    Verdict: I purchased this phone considering the pocket friendly size of the phone and A14 chip. It was later I realised that with the tiny battery the phone actually throttles the cpu power. Hence I don’t see any magic happening while editing photos or videos. Export/Rendering time is same as that of iPhone 7 Plus.",6 months ago,196,196

Delivery -was very good I received the product a day in advance and got a call from flipkart for further security to deliver to me at home with an additional OTP.  Packaging- properly packed no complaints.  Phone specs-  Battery- 1st day powered up to 100 percent around 1.30 PM and then did video call for few hours, downloaded apps , watched movie..still my battery was reduced to 15% by 3 PM next day.. I recharged then but if you don't then it will last much longer at least till night 10PM. I stay with the phone constantly so I will give a big thumbs up on battery..  Camera- I can't even think of comparing with my old moto E5. Back camera is fantastic..though my front camera I found it a bit grainy during concalls but with selfie captures had no issue.. they are good. Another big thumbs up for camera.  OS is good..fast and currently have 8 to 9 Apps running all together  Screen size is big and perfect for students studying and office goers. It's a big phone holding it up for long in hand can be painful..  Display very good.  Sound output I read negative someplace, but I can confirm while taking calls it's loud and clear..good output.

Looks are nice as shown in pic so its a beautiful looking phone.  2. Screen size is good but pixel clarity is not much, just like a china/local phone.  3. UI, fonts are all same as in a china/local fone.  4. Rear speaker is quite loud, but clarity is not that great. it sounds same as a chinese cheap phone.  5. Keypad is rubber, nice n comfortable  6. Main Problem - this fone has A LOT OF LAG. Being a feature phone i did not expected this. there is a terrible lag of about 2 secs whenever u press back key to close any open app/feature. eg. u open contacts the press back, its freezes for 2 secs n then works. its same while u open any other program.    overall operating this fone feels sluggish due to the LAG.","Jan, 2020",21,63

The phone rattles in the vibration, so good vibration motor. The battery is huge for a feature phone. It takes some time getting used to its UI and figuring out all the functions but its worth it. The camera is VGA and pictures are pretty much useless. The signal reception for wireless radio is weaker than wired FM. The sound output through earphones is fantastic. Bluetooth works properly. The music player has an Equaliser!(in its settings); It has 3 inbuilt games. You have to use a SD card to store anything. King talker is available which only speaks out numbers when dialing and receiving a call and tells time every hour. The torch is very bright. The phone has 2000 contacts memory and 250 sms memory.

2709,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Blue, 128 GB)",Va************,5,Excellent Phone! Read My Review.,"If you're in the market for a compact phone with probably the best cameras in a phone today, that does not sacrifice on performance or any of the flagship features then your decision must start and end with an iPhone. First of all Apple has created something that is a throwback to the best smartphones ever designed - the iphone 5 and 5S. While doing so Apple made sure that it did not compromise on power or performance. The 12 mini has all the features (ALL OF THEM!) of the bigger iPhone 12 - so basically its the same A14 processor, same cameras, same RAM, same OLED screen, same FaceID, same wireless charging, same water resistance, same 5G support and everything else! Except that this is a smaller sized phone physically, which is so comfortable to hold that you'll wonder what happened to the smartphone industry getting obsessed over making bigger devices every year.    Fun fact : Literally 8 years ago in 2013 was when the iPhone 5S was announced. That was considered the gold standard in smartphone design. In 8 years we're carrying phones that are getting so uncomfortably big we have forgotten to use them with one hand. You know what's really funny? Human hands have stayed the same size in the last 8 years too. :D    You're not reading this for fun facts. You're really reading this review wondering if the battery life suffers because of the smaller battery on the mini compared to the regular sized iPhone 12. The simple answer - NOT REALLY!. Let me explain. Compared to the regular sized iPhone 12 - you will get ~1.5 hours less in terms of 100% - fully dead battery for the same level of usage on both phones. You can verify this via several YouTube channels that have tested this extensively. So basically for ~1.5 to 2 hours less battery life you get a phone that is so compact, without sacrificing anything else in terms of features. For me personally this means that I love my iPhone 12 mini. Convenience over 2 extra hours of battery life anyday for me. Plus I got a 20W fast charger that charges my mini from 10% - 100% in about ~45 minutes. My phone charges on Apple Carplay while I'm driving too. So 2 less hours of battery life is overrated for me. But you may disagree and that's fine.    Final verdict : If ~1.5 to 2 hours of extra battery backup along with a slightly bigger screen means more for you and how you want to use your phone, buy the regular sized iPhone 12. But for 2 hours less battery backup you prefer the convenience of carrying around a smaller, lighter phone that has everything that the regular 12 has, then buy the 12 mini without a doubt! This is a question of your priorities. ALSO if you're wondering if suddenly typing on a smaller screen will become an issue coming from a bigger phone, you could not be more wrong! It took me all of only 3 hours to get used to typing on this screen.

2769,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (White, 128 GB)",Va************,5,Excellent Phone! Read My Review.,"If you're in the market for a compact phone with probably the best cameras in a phone today, that does not sacrifice on performance or any of the flagship features then your decision must start and end with an iPhone. First of all Apple has created something that is a throwback to the best smartphones ever designed - the iphone 5 and 5S. While doing so Apple made sure that it did not compromise on power or performance. The 12 mini has all the features (ALL OF THEM!) of the bigger iPhone 12 - so basically its the same A14 processor, same cameras, same RAM, same OLED screen, same FaceID, same wireless charging, same water resistance, same 5G support and everything else! Except that this is a smaller sized phone physically, which is so comfortable to hold that you'll wonder what happened to the smartphone industry getting obsessed over making bigger devices every year.    Fun fact : Literally 8 years ago in 2013 was when the iPhone 5S was announced. That was considered the gold standard in smartphone design. In 8 years we're carrying phones that are getting so uncomfortably big we have forgotten to use them with one hand. You know what's really funny? Human hands have stayed the same size in the last 8 years too. :D    You're not reading this for fun facts. You're really reading this review wondering if the battery life suffers because of the smaller battery on the mini compared to the regular sized iPhone 12. The simple answer - NOT REALLY!. Let me explain. Compared to the regular sized iPhone 12 - you will get ~1.5 hours less in terms of 100% - fully dead battery for the same level of usage on both phones. You can verify this via several YouTube channels that have tested this extensively. So basically for ~1.5 to 2 hours less battery life you get a phone that is so compact, without sacrificing anything else in terms of features. For me personally this means that I love my iPhone 12 mini. Convenience over 2 extra hours of battery life anyday for me. Plus I got a 20W fast charger that charges my mini from 10% - 100% in about ~45 minutes. My phone charges on Apple Carplay while I'm driving too. So 2 less hours of battery life is overrated for me. But you may disagree and that's fine.    Final verdict : If ~1.5 to 2 hours of extra battery backup along with a slightly bigger screen means more for you and how you want to use your phone, buy the regular sized iPhone 12. But for 2 hours less battery backup you prefer the convenience of carrying around a smaller, lighter phone that has everything that the regular 12 has, then buy the 12 mini without a doubt! This is a question of your priorities. ALSO if you're wondering if suddenly typing on a smaller screen will become an issue coming from a bigger phone, you could not be more wrong! It took me all of only 3 hours to get used to typing on this screen. Just FYI - I switched to this from a OnePlus 7T so I'm really speaking the truth. :D We tend to underestimate the ability of our brain and fingers on how quickly we can adapt to change. :D",7 months ago,511,2555

I would recommend a screen protector as minor scratches may occur, which might be caused while cleaning the dust off the phone etc. The price you are paying for a relatively small phone might give you a thought but it’s worth every penny.

Gorgeous display, stunning new blue colour, excellent camera, best hardware-software combination, that’s how I would describe iPhone 12 as a package. 😊    Even though my previous iPhone had a 5.5” display and this one has 6.1” display, its overall body size is much smaller. Had to get used to it initially 🙂    Opening/closing/loading of apps is fast. No issues there. Video playback on this screen looks gorgeous. Took the 128GB variant, just so that i don’t have to backup to PC too often.    Battery lasts a day, it drains a bit faster on weekdays when I use its Mobile hotspot for office work. No connectivity issues though.    Few pics attached. Night shots look much better on iPhone 12.    No charging brick in the box. But works with my old iPhones charger/cable. I still ordered 20W fast charging brick separately from Apple site though. And it does charge pretty fast.    Flipkart delivery: Had done pre booking on the day they made it available on Flipkart. Awesome discount and old phone buy back offered. Had initial promised delivery date of 1st Nov, but got delivered on 4th Nov.

Performance wise I don’t see any issue. Phone build quality not good as compared to Samsung or other phones.As this phone is Chinese ,I could see Chinese written in some places , like the charger, sim tray and other places, which I feel disappointed. The phone has 5000 mah battery but It’s feels like it has 2000 ma. Because the percentage of battery drops so quick. Although good part is it has 65 waat superdart charger..which can charge phone in less than 15-20 min. The amoled screen looks really nice. I am happy that atleast the screen is not of cheap quality. I did play cod for around 2-3 hours and there was no heating issue.. also the game was smooth during play with max frame and graphics setting. The camera on phone is decent.

2865,"realme GT NEO 2 (NEO Blue, 256 GB)",De**********,5,Just wow!,"This is a flagship killer for the gamers only. The power this phone packs is insane for the price point.  1. Snapdragon 870 is prone to less thermal throttling and overheating and has a small performance loss over 888 for a good stability boost, perfect for daily driver.  2. The 5000 mAh battery coupled with the 120Hz E4 AMOLED display, meaning one of the biggest power drain source for idle phones, screen time, is controlled, giving you great battery life.  3. Charge your device on the fly with the 65 W charger, and then get a great battery life too. Phenomenal.  4. Love multimedia? The speakers on this one are pretty good, coupled with Dolby Atmos pre-defined profiles, makes the speakers sound great. Still never beating the ROG Phone 5 ones though.  5. Camera is... Okay-ish. This is not a camera flagship so I won't put it too down, but it's definitely not for camera lovers.  6. Realme... Why did you deny us the 3.5mm Audio Jack on this...    Anyways, overall a great purchase for the price point. 100% recommended for performance, not recommended for camera lovers.",20 days ago,114,570
2866,"realme GT NEO 2 (NEO Blue, 256 GB)",em********,5,Wonderful,For me this phone is great  But like any other phones you can't have everything  Here's my honest review which will be helpful  The camera is okay .. I won't say it's great had this camera been on a 15k phone it would have been great but it's a 30k+ phone so I did expected more. .. The camera image quality is good in daylight but in low light conditions I still feel it's camera is that like of a 15-20k phone... That's the only disadvantaged    Now let's talk about the positive thing about this phone  It's Snapdragon 870 5g is one of the best right now in the country  For gaming it's really great it's better than SD 888 as it doesn't heat easily... You will feel a minor warm on the back but it's not like redmi or oneplus warm    If you are a gamer and wants phone to be fully charged at the earliest and the battery is long lasting for a day and if you have the money to go for it then please do    If you are a camera type of person then I won't recommend it to you because this is more of a performance phone it does perform well in everything in camera too but for a 30k phone you expect better    Now the 5g has 8 band which makes it the best 5g phone as of now    I'm a gamer I like fast charging phones which last the whole day plus it's so smooth so I don't regret it    Unless you are a camera person and more of a performance type then go for it no regrets,14 days ago,27,135

Pros:  Big Display  6000 mah battery  Good charge speed 18W  Notification light  4 Camera with front Punch hole cam looks good.  Feels bit Light weight after having 6000mah battery  Best processor at this price. Helio G80  Many features included.    Cons:  Some unwanted pre-installed apps some are Chinese.  Camera is good but not best.  Only 720p video support. Display Quality is Ok but I'm an OnePlus user I can't compare with a 40k mobile so still it's good display at 10k price.    I will suggest this mobile for basic user like family members who needs long battery backup with bigger display.Not for heavy graphic gamers can run games like pubg but not in high quality graphic and display doesn't have high sensitivity rate.

2916,"POCO X3 Pro (Graphite Black, 128 GB)",Ay*****************,5,Just wow!,"Those who are gonna buy this X3P knows very much about pros n cons of the device, I will not waste your n mine time in writing it. Instead I will share my experience of past 1 week with this X3P.  1> First of all I want to clarify that don't compare this device to redmi note 10 series... Both the phones are targeted to different audience.    2> DISPLAY, I would say it's very nice display regarding the price at which you get it with SD860.  Yeah I missed the deeper blacks and punchier colours of an amoled display as my previous phone was Samsung Galaxy S7. But still I will call it a very nice IPS display, 120hz is bonus.    3> WEIGHT n DESIGN, yes it's a heavy phone but not that much heavy as people are saying, within 1to2 days you will get comfortable if your hands are not that small. Also, weight distribution is good, I am using it without cover.  Design wise it's okay, I will not call it good because I don't like this big Poco branding. Also, they should have gone with full matte back battery cover because glossy part is fingerprint magnet.    4> GAMING n PERFORMANCE, you know about this guys. X3P can handle 60fps in all games without overheating except Genshine Impact.  Yes, there is no overheating in the device until unless you are pushing your device to run at very high graphics with high fps or you have switched off the fans of your room.  Regarding performance you know what SD860 is capable of. One thing I like to mention that SD860 handles 120hz display with ease, you will find no stutters while using 120hz as phones with SD732 stutters.  Also, miui feels very smooth on this.    5> CAMERA n SPEAKERS, if you don't care about the details in the captured pictures you will find no difference with clicks of Redmi note 10 pro max.  Yes, both camera performs very similar, RN10Pmax has that detail advantage with its camera.  If your usage is limited upto WA/Twitter/Insta/FB uploads you will not be disappointed.  Well Poco should have given that IMX682(vanilla X3) instead of this IMX582.  Dual stereo Speakers on this X3P is very good and audio balance is also good, you will not find any sound difference between earpiece speaker and bottom speaker. Yes, Back panel have vibrations but I will not call it as a con, at least for me because vibrations at back give more immersive experience to me and gives a little bit bass experience also.  You can eliminate those back vibrations by choosing mono audio in accessibility option.  Output through headphones are also very good.    VERDICT-> Those who have bought the device including me also knows the compromises they have made i.e an amoled display and a glass sandwich design.  If you are okay to sacrifice these two things, I am damn sure you're gonna love this X3P.  Well it's a known fact that Xiaomi gives the best device for every price point in the market, with worst UI😅. Yes MiUi is feature rich but also have many bugs.  Presently I don't find any bugs in miui 12.0.4 which comes with this device, hope this bugless experience continues with the next upcoming updates also🤞.    One last thing I want to say regarding the flipkart services, delivery was on time and packaging was also good.  But flipkart is running scam regarding exchange of the phone specially during the sale days. I ordered the X3P with exchange offer, the offer was to exchange any smartphone with no damaged screen but body dent was acceptable. Usually delivery boy deffer the price the of the phone if there is any dent found on the phone which has to be exchanged, but in my case delivery boy simply rejected the exchange which was against the offer. I was totally disappointed with this.  I wanted to give bad rating, but it was flipkart's fault not the seller or the device. So gave genuine rating for the product.  I will again update my experience after 3 months when miui 12.5 will arrive.  Hope you find my experience useful🤞👍",5 months ago,2148,10740
2917,"POCO X3 Pro (Graphite Black, 128 GB)",Ma***********,5,Must buy!,"I will share my review after using this for more than 15 days  The product is what you expect  The performance is amazing but the only thing which is not good is miui 12 i hope that the next miui version will fix the minor lag which is only due to nonoptimized software.  The camera is not that bad you will get a decent picture with enough details and i don't think that i can really differentiate between the 64 mp realme camera and this poco camera so go for it also you can easily use gcam which will further increase the camera performance.  Battery performance is amazing and so the charging speed it can charge your phone to from 0 to 50-60% in just 20-25 minutes also full charge requires 70 to 75 minutes.  Display is decent, brightness is the only thing which this phone lacks.  120hz is butter smooth and you will rarely feel any lag unlike other 120hz phone with normal processor like 720g 732g or dimensity 800u so here you can enjoy real 120hz display.  Speaker quality is awesome and so is the microphone.  So you can easily go for this device because this processor will compete the mid range processor for atleast 3 to 4 years but if you buy the mid range processor phone like 720g or 732g than after a year or two the phone will disappoint you and you will feel to change the mobile so i will suggest just go for this device.

One among the most pathetic products offered by HMD global under Nokia brand. For the price they are selling it at, the single speaker for ear piece and music/ringtone is awfully low in sound. The speakers should be audible enough if not then what's the purpose of feature phone? The screen is decent enough and the wireless fm is good feature to have.

While using camera use AI mode always to enhance the color, and turn on the 64 MP and HDR mode. The bokeh flare mode looks nice. Macro Lense is standard. Zooming more than 5x is not advisable. Selfie camera is more than good. I'm really happy with it. Overall camera is good with correct settings.      Display:    90 Hz amoled display looks really fluid.

The first few minutes, I get 60 fps in battle royale games like CODM and PUBGM. But after a while, I get around 15 fps and major frame drops. The camera and display are both great. Same goes for fast charging. I use the phone all day on a single charge. If I game, it takes about 2 charges to last a day. Moving from SD450 to G95, so I'm actually happy.  Low light selfies aren't that great, but low light pictures on rear camera are excellent. Loving the great AMOLED display.

Cheapest phone 📱 with 128gb and fingerprint unlock.  Lots of junk apps but fortunately most can be deleted.  Spam notification with ads are annoying giving it a cheap and trashy feel.  Dual wi-fi working compared to 9i which can't connect to 5ghz.  Gyroscope is better than redmi so it's easy to play any games that require tilting.  My theory is that redmi decided to save money and use some software gyroscope instead of hardware.  Processor is slow so games like real racing 3 drop frames even when compared to iPad 2 from 9 years ago.  Everything else seems fine in the first week of use.  Can't mute notifications directly like on redmi, you have to go through settings and the app which is a pain.  Ugly colour but was the only variant available and can be hidden with a back cover.

I didn't face any heating issues till now. Sound quality is very nice on Dolby atmos mode.  One and only thing i Don't like is it's back panel. Its very thin and low quality.

Camera amazing , performance 90HZ amazing , display no words for display , battery 4500MH is enough for if you are a normal user otherwise if you are a gaming person then its little bit difficult for them to battery backup but still its good optimization to handle . No heating issue , water and dust proof .  Hope you like my review",7 months ago,37,185

The display and speaker are superb. The camera performance is also upto the mark. There are no such lags upon normal usage (thanks to the Snapdragon processor), although the device gets quite warm when put to charge. Overall it is a good purchase, would have been great if the battery was of at least 5000mAh at this price range. I would surely recommend this phone.",7 months ago,84,336
3099,"SAMSUNG Galaxy A52 (Awesome Black, 128 GB)",Ja***************,5,Excellent,"Perfect phone for all types of users.  (Review after 1 week usage)  Processor- I'm surprised to see this performance in a samsung phone.  performance is great. No lag, no heating issue for normal usage and while gaming also there is no over heating issue and no lag in high graphic settings.    Battery -  For 2-3 hours gaming, YouTube, social media and calling I'm getting upto 12 hours backup. Battery could be better.    Camera-  OIS is great, but struggles in low light conditions.  Other than that camera is awesome.  Refer some YouTube for details camera reviews  Super study mode is very good but video resolution is not good in super study mode.    Design-  Backside looks is good but camera hump is quite high and Mobile is not that much handy as compare to a50. Back panels easily get scratches so we should use a back cover.    Display-  Great display, camera hole is very small so looks great, viewing angles are good.    Speaker-  Stereo speakers are very good and supports Dolby. So we will get wonderful experience while watching films and videos.    Charging-  It will takes 1.45 hours to complete charge with in box 15w charger. Mobile supports 25w charger which is not included in the box. In 25w charger mobile charges in approx 1 hour.    Finger print-  Finger print scanner not fast as side/rear mounted. But does its job even after applying tempered glass. Tips to speedup biometric scanner- turn of unlocking animation and go to battery optimization - search com.samsong.biometric - disable battery optimization.    Phone's vibration is very weak .    Some files like Spotify offline downloads and some big files are automatically deleted. So go to battery and device care - click on 3 dots which can be seen at top right side then select storage booster here turn off auto delete unnecessary data.",5 months ago,19,95

Must Say micromax has made a strong comeback with IN note 1. Will be talking about in sequence manner:-  1. Built quality/quality control:-  Design is superb I suggest green color looks really amazing and beautiful. Buttons are quite good and screen is surprisingly really bright and good. Wifi and Bluetooth connectivity and calling is all excellent.  2. Performance:-  The customized stock android is really smooth with Helio G85 processor.  3. Battery:-  This mobile really outperforms in this section must say battery is damm legit, it lasts for 2 days completely even if use it more a day. Also the fast charging with 18W adapter charges in 25 mins to 50% and 100% in 2hrs(approx).  4.Camera:-  Some of the samples clicked from this phone looks good. Well the nightmode is really amazing and talking about it's AI functioning it comesout really good.    Lastly some cons is that while taking portrait shots it doesn't take a proper portrait. Yes I clicked this pictures after their first updates. So yes this can be fix if they send a further update which will better work on this.    My Opinion is that supporting our brand will be key to them and yes it's in our hand to make it big or not.

Soo i would definitely recommend you to buy this phone if you are looking for good connectivity and performance smartphone in this price range.  Soo Don't hold back! 👍🤗,4 months ago,686,3430
3145,"POCO M3 Pro 5G (Power Black, 64 GB)",SH*******,5,Highly recommended,"It is a good budget 5G phone. I loved it. Good performance is giving out from dimensity 700🔥🔥.  The mediatek dimensity 700 give a performance equalent to Snapdragon 732G in gaming. Almost the two processor Antu Antu score is almost equal.But one of disadvantages of mediatek is game optimization is less compared to Snapdragon. In future the app developer of games will fix this issue. My complete review is down here👇      1.👉 Good performance at this price range  2. 👉Good battery backup it last more than one day. I got screen on time upto 10hrs  3.👉90hz display is good and it is very smooth. It's automatically dynamic refresh rate switching features is very good, we don't have to change manually in settings while gaming.  4. 👉360 degree proximity sensor is very good.  5. 👉5G connectivity, is very good. Almost all 5G band are offering in mediatek dimensity 700. In dimensity 800U not all bands available which is in the dimensity 700.  6.👉18w fast charging is there, it take maximum 2hrs to full charge. But my suggestion is that they have to include 33W fast charging like in poco m2 pro. Due to 5G, they don't provide that😭.  7.👉The Poco M3 Pro has a high-res main camera. It relies on a 48MP OmniVision OV48B 1/2"" sensor with 0.8µm pixels, Quad-Bayer filter and PDAF. The lens is 26mm f/1.8. Night Mode is available on this imager.  The macro camera uses a 2MP Hynix Hi-259 sensor with large 1.75µm pixels. The lens is f/2.4, while the focus is fixed at about 4cm-5cm distance.    The third shooter at the back is a 2MP GalaxyCore GC02M1B monochrome depth sensor.    The selfie camera uses an 8MP OmniVision OV8856 1/4"" sensor with 1.12µm pixels. It sits behind an f/2.0 lens, and the focus is fixed.  8.👉 It offers UFS 2.2 storage which is 10 times better than UFS 2.1.  9.👉 The mobile phone is design is very attractive and stylish 🔥😍😍  10.👉 Dual tone flashlight is very good feature.          Overall good phone........ Just go for it. If you prefer in camera I don't recommend this, because camera quality is not better. Overall good phone. Main thing is performance which is very good at this price range.",4 months ago,275,1375

3235,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Green, 64 GB)",Va************,5,Excellent Phone! Read My Review.,"If you're in the market for a compact phone with probably the best cameras in a phone today, that does not sacrifice on performance or any of the flagship features then your decision must start and end with an iPhone. First of all Apple has created something that is a throwback to the best smartphones ever designed - the iphone 5 and 5S. While doing so Apple made sure that it did not compromise on power or performance. The 12 mini has all the features (ALL OF THEM!) of the bigger iPhone 12 - so basically its the same A14 processor, same cameras, same RAM, same OLED screen, same FaceID, same wireless charging, same water resistance, same 5G support and everything else! Except that this is a smaller sized phone physically, which is so comfortable to hold that you'll wonder what happened to the smartphone industry getting obsessed over making bigger devices every year.    Fun fact : Literally 8 years ago in 2013 was when the iPhone 5S was announced. That was considered the gold standard in smartphone design. In 8 years we're carrying phones that are getting so uncomfortably big we have forgotten to use them with one hand. You know what's really funny? Human hands have stayed the same size in the last 8 years too. :D    You're not reading this for fun facts. You're really reading this review wondering if the battery life suffers because of the smaller battery on the mini compared to the regular sized iPhone 12. The simple answer - NOT REALLY!. Let me explain. Compared to the regular sized iPhone 12 - you will get ~1.5 hours less in terms of 100% - fully dead battery for the same level of usage on both phones. You can verify this via several YouTube channels that have tested this extensively. So basically for ~1.5 to 2 hours less battery life you get a phone that is so compact, without sacrificing anything else in terms of features. For me personally this means that I love my iPhone 12 mini. Convenience over 2 extra hours of battery life anyday for me. Plus I got a 20W fast charger that charges my mini from 10% - 100% in about ~45 minutes. My phone charges on Apple Carplay while I'm driving too. So 2 less hours of battery life is overrated for me. But you may disagree and that's fine.    Final verdict : If ~1.5 to 2 hours of extra battery backup along with a slightly bigger screen means more for you and how you want to use your phone, buy the regular sized iPhone 12. But for 2 hours less battery backup you prefer the convenience of carrying around a smaller, lighter phone that has everything that the regular 12 has, then buy the 12 mini without a doubt! This is a question of your priorities. ALSO if you're wondering if suddenly typing on a smaller screen will become an issue coming from a bigger phone, you could not be more wrong! It took me all of only 3 hours to get used to typing on this screen. Just FYI - I switched to this from a OnePlus 7T so I'm really speaking the truth. :D We tend to underestimate the ability of our brain and fingers on how quickly we can adapt to change. :D",7 months ago,511,2555
3236,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Green, 64 GB)",Na******************,4,Nice product,"As per my usage I think the battery is adequate as I don’t often use my phone and at the end of the as per my usage the battery percentage remains at 40% but if you are a heavy user then you might feel the drain. The screen is small and typing might be an issue but after few minutes on you’ll get used to it, the camera and the screen are awesome and the picture quality superb as per my liking. I would recommend a screen protector as minor scratches may occur, which might be caused while cleaning the dust off the phone etc. The price you are paying for a relatively small phone might give you a thought but it’s worth every penny. Light and durable phone and the shape reminds of the older IPhones the 5 & 5s for me which was the best designed iPhone ever regardless of the size",10 months ago,691,2764

3238,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Green, 64 GB)",Vi*******,1,Waste of money!,"Brilliant processor with a tiny battery.    Pro: This phone has the fastest processor in the world.  Con: With a tiny battery & small screen they aren’t pretty useful.    Pro: Supports Dolby Vision HDR Video recording and playback  Con: once you export the video to laptop or pendrive to watch it in big screen, dolby vision disappears from the video and it gets converted to SD. This defeats the whole purpose of having a dolby vision recording facility    Pro: low light photography is really good  Con: Photos no longer look natural. There’s some color correction happening and that makes the photo looks warmer.    Verdict: I purchased this phone considering the pocket friendly size of the phone and A14 chip. It was later I realised that with the tiny battery the phone actually throttles the cpu power. Hence I don’t see any magic happening while editing photos or videos. Export/Rendering time is same as that of iPhone 7 Plus.",6 months ago,196,196

Thanks for one day in advance delivery. This is my first infinix mobile.This is my 3rd day usage only. At the outset this mobile looks somewhat premium though plastic built-up. Somany inbuilt useful features. Thanks to Infinix. Regarding display it is big like tablet but due to its height easy to hold and use. But display brightness is low even in indoor when compared to redmi, mi, realme, samsung, techno mobiles which I have used and using now. For comfortable sharp viewing brightness should be put in full. I feel in daylight display visibility is almost not up to mark. I hope infinix will definitely improve screen brightness by immediate software updates. Cameras back and front are ok for normal photography. If it is improved by software updates then this note 10 pro is one of the best in this segment. Regarding ram management it requires lot of improvements. Though it is 8 gb ram, around 3 gb only available almost all the time. 256 GB storage is the highlight. So definitely there will be no chance for storage shortage. Even if we want more space then we can use dedicated sd card. Screen refresh rate also good so far. Fingerprint, face unlock are fast enough. Next i feel battery management should improve. I am not a heavy user. But battery is draining very fast. Within 5 hours of normal usage 50 percent of battery drained. For the past 3 days i am charging this phone twice a day. Speakers are sounding well and audible. This is also good part of this mobile. In general frequent software updates are essential for any kind or brand mobiles. Infinix should also provide software updates then and there. Out of the box this mobile i am having now updated till March 2021 only. I hope that infinix will definitely sort out (1) battery draining, (2)screen brightness, (3)cameras performance, (4)better ram management atleast up to 6 gb out of 8 gb ram etc.issues by OTA updates.

Battery lasts long. They promised for three days however, last two full days with moderate usage.  2. Android 11 is working good. No lags even at multiple apps running.  3. Display is good enough. Cannot expect the kind of quality we get in samsung or today's china made phones. However very much satisfied  4. Sturdy and good design.  5. Camera is above average. However, those who buy phones only for camera must not buy this one. You get better options at this price.  6. Charging doesn't take more than 2 hours. Got full in about 1hour 45 minutes from 26%  7. I got the phone at 11550 which seemed like a good price for the configuration and brand. Value for money at this range.    Bads:  1. The body is not built like earlier nokia versions I had used. I used a solid 6.1 model which was metal. This one however has a plastic body. I was in love with 6.1's body and finishing.    Nothing else as of now.

3384,"POCO M2 Pro (Green and Greener, 128 GB)",রা*********,5,Terrific,"Hi all,  As I have bought Poco M2 pro on first sale, I would like to share my review on this.  I would give you my honest experience..  I will talk only about the Lacunas/cons of this phone,  1.Battery-it lasts only for 24 hrs by general use,(like phone call, YouTube, whatsup video call) without gaming, while gaming it's battery drains fastly, for charging it takes 1.21 hrs.  2.Camera-As it is 48 MP, I personally did not find anything like 48 MP, rather samsung M30 has better quality of pics than this 48 MP, Night mode is not good enough,Its just a hipe,clarity has to be compromised,  Even front camera is not good, pics get blurr by zoom. Same here samsung M30 again have gain..  So camera is not as good as they told., blur and shaggy images, I have really disappointed.  3.Display- kindly go for super Amoled display, if you compare FHD of Poco M2 pro and sAmoled of samsung you will really feel the difference,  4.Gaming has heating problem,battery drains fastly,  5.weight is something I feel heavy, hard to use by single hand.  6.sound is average,  So it's my honest feedback after using it for 10 days. I really feel disappointed.(camera, display)  Now other things like processor, interface,speed, design, finger print sensor are best.  Thanks 👍","Aug, 2020",4066,20330
3385,"POCO M2 Pro (Green and Greener, 128 GB)",Ch*************,4,Really Nice,This phone comes with decent specifications....And the audio output is pretty good. One who is looking for best camera then you should not buy this..though it has a samsung isocell camera sensor..it struggles a lot while focusing...Redmi note 7 pro even came with sony sensor...then i don't know why the upcoming phones are coming with samsung sensor  While coming to the battery part...it gives a excellent battery backup..Screen On time would be 9.5hrs max .  Display is good..  I appreciate this phone because of still using headphone jack.  Hats off to dedicated slot..  I I'll give 1star for the camera of this phone....  Come on we don't need macro sensor ...for this you can give main camera in sony sensor with aperture lower than 1.6..  Look out these photos...these are clicked by Redmi note 7 pro...

3408,"realme GT NEO 2 (NEO Black, 128 GB)",Su*****,5,Fabulous!,"Thank You FLIPKART ❣️  This is my genuine review after using the devices for 5 days.  Looks & Feels Very Premium. Got the sporty Neon green Colour.  A good quality case is also provided though it will more suited for black variant but it does the work for me until I get a new one.  Processor & Os - I have purchased 8GB/128GB variant, it has also got a 5GB dynamic RAM Expansion. It comes with a SD870 7nm processor which is very nice & the realme UI 2.0 runs like a charm. I encountered no hiccups at all while using the device...not a single one.  Screen & Audio - 120 GHz E4 AMOLED is very bright & punchy. Its the first realme device with HDR10+ certification. It doesn't come with a 3.5 mm jack but that's ok for me as I have barely used that in my previous mobile (It can be a negative point for hardcore gamers). It is a Aptx HD certified device & support HD wireless sound profile. I have watched 4k HDR 10bit videos with Atmos sound & the experience was amazing.  Camera - Camera is good but image processing was not good enough. You can click amazing pics in good lit condition but in low light conditions image came out to be grainy. Front cam is good. Images were little too saturated but finally the issue is sorted out with the latest software update & front cam pics are now awesome & I mean it. Use GCam.  Games - Though I rarely use mobile device for heavy gaming, but this device does surprised me. My initial gaming experience was good. Graphics were brilliant. Response was fast. I will update it later with long time review.  Software - Realme UI 2.0 is nice & there are lot of customisation options. It does comes with bloatware but you can get rid of most of it by simply uninstall or adb tools.  Battery - 5000mah battery does the work well & can easily last for a day with moderate usage & for high end gaming it will give U 6 hrs of SOT easily.  General Usage - Call quality is awsome just like any flagship device. 4G+ is supported. Does come with 8 band 5G profile but we have to wait for that. Wifi 6 is an added feature & U can connect to 2 Wifi connections at the same time for some apps supporting Dual acceleration. Typing in this device is a charm. Haptics are so good...& are optimised like a pro device.  My final Verdict - Go for it guys. This is a GT for a no Nonsense experience. Looking forward to Android 12 based Realme UI 3.0",17 days ago,24,120

3479,"Itel Vision1 (Gradation Green, 32 GB)",sh******************,4,Good choice,"1st of all , let me share the cons :☹️  1)its IPS display is average.  2) charging time {from 0 to 100) 4:30 hours.😔  3) downloading speed is very slow.😒  4)back camera performance is not up to the mark.  it captures average quality photo compared to  realme c2.😕  5)the processor's frequency is little slow .  (4×1.6 GHz +4×1.2 GHz) compared to realme c2.  6)The processor's architecture is 28 nano meter (nm)  thus, there is heating issue(i feel) and battery  consumption issue compared to realme c2 which  has 12 nm architecture .😫  {less nm = more performance}  7)the company doesn't provide a back cover .  8)speaker quality is average.  9)the itel OS is seems to be similar to cheetah OS  which is in infinix mobiles.  10)we don't know about the glass quality .  (whether it is gorilla glass or not)  11)the touch screen is not so responsive (as i feel)  (cheetah OS is not very secure as I heard OK )  12){optional} I don't think itel will provide any future  updates ( such as android 10 and security patch )  because the company did not claimed about it.  therefore it is a great drawback.🤐    NOW,  lets proceed to the pros : 😋  1)the front camera clicks decent photos.  2)the design is really awesome.😍  3)the process spreadtrum sc9863a has arm cortex  A55 comparatively better than arm cortex A53  (in realme c2)its 20% faster more faster than A53.  4) I did not get any ad on it.(there is no ad may be)  5)ram management is good and good for multi  tasking as it has 3gb ram.  6)It supports split screen ,i did listen music in youtube  and internet surfing simultaneously. its really good  i did not feel any lack on it.😊  7)It has default video calling option which is fantastic.  8)though the frequency is less , the app opening time  is pretty good. I did not feel any lagging.  9)the rear camera has professional photography  mode option . which is fantastic😌  10)battery backup is quite decent.  11)the mobile is quite handy . that feels good.  12)the screen brightness in outdoor is good enough.  as i was playing free fire in Sunshine , i didn't feel  much problem of visibility.  13)and finally don't forget one thing, it has FINGER  PRINT SENSOR which is very fast and which is  missing in realme c2( thats a huge draw back  of realme c2).    PERSONALLY I AM A REALME 6 USER ! AND THIS MOBILE HAS QUITE IMPRESSED ME . ITS NOT TOO BAD I FEELS BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE OF USAGE.  i thought of buying realme c2 . but the problem is that realme c2 does not have finger print sensor . and i really hate about it . therefore i choose to buy this mobile . i checked the battery charging test of realme c2 on youtube and i got no difference . it took same time to recharge the battery. and the performance statistics is also comparatively as good as realme c2.  also one thing , i was getting realme c2 of ram 2gb and itel vision 1 with 3 gb ram at same price. therefore why to choose 2 gb ram😂 instead i finally decided to buy this .  you see, i am a realme 6 user and if i have liked this mobile and if this is quite impressive to me , then definitely you will also like this mobile . i guarantee you.  THEREFORE, BUY IT MY FRIEND 😉☺️    i have wasted 1 hour to write this review . if you find it helpful , then please give a 👍.  🙏🙏🙏JAI HIND🙏🙏🙏","Aug, 2020",1389,5556

Here are things I want to share with you    Pros:  ->Superb Performance, 860 or I must say an over-clocked version of 855+ (855+ was released 2 years from now,  Marketing strategy: OP)  ->120 Hz display makes it super smooth  ->Speakers are loud, good for gamers stereo speakers are present.  ->Battery Backup is good  ->Liquid cooling is decent.    Cons:  ->Frames drop is rare but it happens.  ->If someone is saying that this phone does not have any heating issues, they will be lying.  ->The temperature shoots up within the first 5-10 mins of gaming. But the liquid cooling is decent enough to maintain and get it below 45(while gaming)  ->The temperature can reach above 50 degrees:  ->while charging(even you're not using the phone) I have seen this for the first 15 mins, then it gets back to normal(weird right?)  ->while playing games like COC (like seriously?)  ->After playing the game, the phone behaves quite weirdly  ->Display is okay, don't even compare with AMOLED (AMOLED displays are far far far better than IPS LCD panel).  ->Build quality is cheap, even mobiles under 15k have better build quality. The back panel vibrates while playing music.    Lastly,  If you want a phone with a good camera, don't buy it, don't believe those YouTubers who say its camera is decent, the front camera is bad to be honest.",6 months ago,107,428

CONS-  SECURITY-  There is a big security issue in this budget smartphones as you can see in above images the system apps like gallery,music player, sound recorder are asking permission to make and manage phone calls and without the permission the app doesn't work, what's the need of permission to manage phone calls in this basic apps, company should seriously roll out a update to fix this.  Dual volte-  dual volte does not work in any sim you can use volte only in one sim at a time as you can see in above image.  Notification led-  This phone does not have notification led it is shown as it have notification led in description of product on flipkart.  Battery backup-  Battery backup is average it only lasts half day on minimum usage and it takes 3 and a half-hour to charge up full  Pros-  Grip is awesome in this smartphone it is very easy to carry along.  It has many features such as double tap to wake,sleep  Flip to mute alarm,phone  Put your ear towards phone to accept phone call or put your ear towards phone to go to handset mode from speaker mode  Pick up phone to wake the screen  Net speed-  Net speed and network is best in this device.

3658,"GIONEE Max (Red, 32 GB)",dr******************,5,Highly recommended,Frankly speaking it is one of the most best budget phone with best of specifications and display and basic functionality at this price point. You can get this features on other phones as well but certainly not at this price. It is can be used for rough and tough purpose an extensive daily uses if you want to keep a second phone.really I do not have much idea about any phone specification and their speed at this price point but I do certainly feel it is really more then what the prices set at. If you are expecting something best within 5000 or 5500 just close your eyes and buy it.  The display is as good as amoled display at this price point. My experience and review is unbiased as I am already using Google pixel 4A and iPhone and iPad pro but at the same time I wanted to to gift my mother in law a budget and a very user friendly phone with big battery but after buying it I was amazed to find that my past Motorola G7 phone and Motorola E4 Plus looks nowhere near it both in functions in speed and price. I liked it so much that I purchased another one for my driver also.  So here is my final outcome and verdict.    The phone working speed is as good as any 10 to 15 thousand priced phone at least far better than G7 Motorola which I purchased last year for 17000 ke but still lags than Gionee Max.  It has a wonderful and speedy face unlock feature which my pixel 4A and even Motorola G7 do not have it.  And not to talk about the battery which is the best part it's a battery beast.  I would give four out of five in camera quality which I am still testing but feel like the pictures are very original real like. And if you can get this phone with cashback on cards it will be extra treat to your pocket also.  And lastly and not the least it is is made in India product.,"Oct, 2020",20,100

Gionee is a good brand and it's mobile last long if you are a good user. I am personally using Gionee M2 as my secondary device from past 5.5 years.  Gionee max is a very good mid ranger phone and it has a good user interface. It suits best for average to mid range user.

Could easily last for more than 2 days with screen on time of more than 10 hours on a single sim.  3- There is some issue with the auto brightness sensor.. the display keeps getting din. Hope it can be fixed with a software update.  4- Best device for elderly people and Light users. Gets the job done. Calls and network reception is perfect. Vowifi works without any issue.  5- No adds.. Except some notifications from the browser app. One can turn it off.  6- Camera is okay for occasional outings... cannot expect great pics at this price.  7- The back with a textured matt finish is great.

Wonderful display quality with tiny punch hole f. camera.  2. Very good quality super amoled display with upto 1200 nits high brightness.  3. 120 Hz refresh rate is working very smooth like butter.  4. Snapdragon 732G gaming processor is working very fast.  5. Excellent camera. Macro is working very well. Very neat focusing and clear display. It even captures tiny dust particles! Also various features are given like Long exposure, slo-mo, timelapse, clone, Vlog mode, pro colour, etc..    6.The night mode is great.. captures the exact environment even in complete darkness.  7. 4k 30 fps video recording is awesome.    Cons :-  1. The device gets heated while gaming.  2. The battery backup should be better.  3. 33W fast charging is not working as promised.

Literally feels pretty smooth (refresh rate of 120 hz has to be set manually). Gaming experience is quite well (COD & 8 ball pool). Camera- outdoor and indoor during day time is very good but it shows a lot of noise on output of nightmode cam, rest of its feature working quite well except that 108mp doesn't really feels that much. Look wise it's too good, but feels heavy even with the provided back cover. You might face a lot of glitches in the UI, but those would be fixed in future updates (keep updating MIUI). It has a slight heating issue, but it's not over heating. Display is outstanding. Overall performance is very good and satisfies the value for money. It doesn't have a notification light, so it has some other cool way of notifying (leaving that to you to find it yourself as surprise). Battery life is quite good as well.  Finally, i would like to suggest you to buy Redmi note 10 pro (8gb + 128gb) at this price if you don't have to brag about the 108mp cam, cause it's basically useless...

Dual volte-  dual volte does not work in any sim you can use volte only in one sim at a time as you can see in above image.  Notification led-  This phone does not have notification led it is shown as it have notification led in description of product on flipkart.  Battery backup-  Battery backup is average it only lasts half day on minimum usage and it takes 3 and a half-hour to charge up full  Pros-  Grip is awesome in this smartphone it is very easy to carry along.  It has many features such as double tap to wake,sleep  Flip to mute alarm,phone  Put your ear towards phone to accept phone call or put your ear towards phone to go to handset mode from speaker mode  Pick up phone to wake the screen  Net speed-  Net speed and network is best in this device.

3752,"GIONEE Max (Black, 32 GB)",dr******************,5,Highly recommended,Frankly speaking it is one of the most best budget phone with best of specifications and display and basic functionality at this price point. You can get this features on other phones as well but certainly not at this price. It is can be used for rough and tough purpose an extensive daily uses if you want to keep a second phone.really I do not have much idea about any phone specification and their speed at this price point but I do certainly feel it is really more then what the prices set at. If you are expecting something best within 5000 or 5500 just close your eyes and buy it.  The display is as good as amoled display at this price point. My experience and review is unbiased as I am already using Google pixel 4A and iPhone and iPad pro but at the same time I wanted to to gift my mother in law a budget and a very user friendly phone with big battery but after buying it I was amazed to find that my past Motorola G7 phone and Motorola E4 Plus looks nowhere near it both in functions in speed and price. I liked it so much that I purchased another one for my driver also.  So here is my final outcome and verdict.    The phone working speed is as good as any 10 to 15 thousand priced phone at least far better than G7 Motorola which I purchased last year for 17000 ke but still lags than Gionee Max.  It has a wonderful and speedy face unlock feature which my pixel 4A and even Motorola G7 do not have it.  And not to talk about the battery which is the best part it's a battery beast.  I would give four out of five in camera quality which I am still testing but feel like the pictures are very original real like. And if you can get this phone with cashback on cards it will be extra treat to your pocket also.  And lastly and not the least it is is made in India product.,"Oct, 2020",20,100

The only issue I observed in the mobile that it gets warm and the battery gets drain fast if you do multi-tasking on it. Rest everything is fine for me in this mobile.,10 months ago,53,212

I strongly recommend this phone to people who is more work oriented. Game loves should skip this phone as this is not a game phone.    Best features with stunning looks & performance.

3772,"APPLE iPhone SE (Black, 128 GB)",ab***********,5,Classy product,"This is my second iphone after iphone 4s. I’ve been a long time android user in between. I’ll tell you who this phone is for. Prospective buyers can then decide    1. For photo and video enthusiasts. Very reliable camera. Fast and excellent picture quality. Videos are absolutely stable and professional quality. You would be amazed how many people shoot Youtube videos on an iPhone. The only downside is that the display doesn’t do justice to the photos and videos you have taken. Night photos are also not that great but if you get Neural cam app for 400 bucks its well worth it.    2. Very reliable performance. No lag whatsoever. All major apps work better than android counterparts. Internet connection is also more stable. It functions exactly how a smartphone should be.    3. Its fun when you have more apple devices. I have an iPad and airdrop is an amazing feature    4. For those who don’t want to lug a heavy oversized phone in your pocket and but needs all that high end power in a compact form, this phone is the perfect choice.    5. For those who don’t play heavy games and media consumption is moderate. Isn’t that how life supposed to be? More living and less glued to your phone? This is one of the main reasons I switched to this phone. Reduce your big screen and media consumption addiction.    6. If you are okay with charging every night after a day of moderate usage.    Its just a phone. There are much more important things in your life. Don’t waste too much time on this.    Thank you for reading.","Aug, 2020",1019,5095

Cons: 1) The major disadvantage in using this Phone I found in the Battery, As Apple has given an official statement of having ""13 hrs of video playback on full charged"" is not true as Battery get drained within 4 hrs of usage, so if you are using a phone for longer duration don't go for this phone.    2) Screen Size 4.7"" seems to be very short as per the cost of the phone. It could be at least 5.3"".    3) Iphone SE has an Heating problem, I don't whether this issue is encountered in every Iphone or not, but in my Phone it is there & phone gets heated very badly in sudden. while having on video call , gaming or while charging.    4) Hotspot is taking atleast 8 to 10 min while connecting it to other systems Wifi or laptop Wifi which is another major cons I observed.","May, 2020",130,390

Battery-now a days what ever brand is the main feature is battery life , for this mid range mobile A21S giving awesome powerback experience the people who need good camera , performance and battery life this mobile is good. Because third party company's tested this mobile to give awesome battery experience .and Rated (minimum) capacity is 4,900 mAh. Actual battery life may vary depending on network environment, usage patterns and other factors.  Coming to performance side give a little bit disappointment for gamers , for normal use (less graphical games) performance is excellent, for pubg this range mobile is excellent but using long time little bit disappointment. Other than all are good. I fully satisfied @battery backup , @camera and @performance. Thank you samsung& flipcart . actually this is my second samsung handset years back i buy Galaxy variant but unfortunately that is Korean peace that I think that I never buy samsung , but after my friend suggested to that buy original product you get awesome experience so again i buy this product, now i am fully happy and changed my desition about samsung. Buyers be aware of Froud products that product s also same as original .. please buy trusted websites. Thank you.","Oct, 2020",14,70

Battery 🔋 ok .. i had options to buy those chinese but they have bugs in theri each update 🤧.. and here Samsung wins hence i bought it ... Phone is okay .. no such problem",8 months ago,6,24

Delivery -was very good I received the product a day in advance and got a call from flipkart for further security to deliver to me at home with an additional OTP.  Packaging- properly packed no complaints.  Phone specs-  Battery- 1st day powered up to 100 percent around 1.30 PM and then did video call for few hours, downloaded apps , watched movie..still my battery was reduced to 15% by 3 PM next day.. I recharged then but if you don't then it will last much longer at least till night 10PM. I stay with the phone constantly so I will give a big thumbs up on battery..  Camera- I can't even think of comparing with my old moto E5. Back camera is fantastic..though my front camera I found it a bit grainy during concalls but with selfie captures had no issue.. they are good. Another big thumbs up for camera.  OS is good..fast and currently have 8 to 9 Apps running all together  Screen size is big and perfect for students studying and office goers. It's a big phone holding it up for long in hand can be painful..  Display very good.  Sound output I read negative someplace, but I can confirm while taking calls it's loud and clear..good output.  The phone has a glossy look not Matt finish..  Overall a good purchase, thanks to Flipkart and to seller for this amazing experience..",3 months ago,40,200

This phone gives a really good battery backup if your a normal users like me , but first things first this is not a gaming phone , you can play pubg and you will find lags even if it's not in hd graphics.    The 12+2+2 mp cameras can capture a really good photos and it also has portrait mode , 6x zoom and macro lens which I find coordinates perfectly.    The selfie camera (8mp) also provides amazing selfies.    The security system in this phone is what I really liked so much    The fingerprint sensor is really fast just touch and your phone opens instantly.    The facial unlock is not as Fast as fingerprint , but you neednot press the power button to use facial unlock , just pickup the phone and it automatically turn on the screen.    The display is also pretty good with 720P resolution.    It has 3d anesthetic design.I bought mystery black variant .    Overall I give this product 4 stars totally .","Jun, 2020",2109,10545

3945,Itel Muzik 400,pr****************,5,Classy product,"Worth purchasing  This phone has a ridiculously loud stereo speaker and sound volume is also better than many smartphones. The phone rattles in the vibration, so good vibration motor. The battery is huge for a feature phone. It takes some time getting used to its UI and figuring out all the functions but its worth it. The camera is VGA and pictures are pretty much useless. The signal reception for wireless radio is weaker than wired FM. The sound output through earphones is fantastic. Bluetooth works properly. The music player has an Equaliser!(in its settings); It has 3 inbuilt games. You have to use a SD card to store anything. King talker is available which only speaks out numbers when dialing and receiving a call and tells time every hour. The torch is very bright. The phone has 2000 contacts memory and 250 sms memory.

This phone gives a really good battery backup if your a normal users like me , but first things first this is not a gaming phone , you can play pubg and you will find lags even if it's not in hd graphics.    The 12+2+2 mp cameras can capture a really good photos and it also has portrait mode , 6x zoom and macro lens which I find coordinates perfectly.    The selfie camera (8mp) also provides amazing selfies.    The security system in this phone is what I really liked so much    The fingerprint sensor is really fast just touch and your phone opens instantly.    The facial unlock is not as Fast as fingerprint , but you neednot press the power button to use facial unlock , just pickup the phone and it automatically turn on the screen.

Doesn't have any memory so if u click pictures as soon as you get the product it simply says insert memory card and camera closes itself.  2. Other than that no issues found till now.

Dual volte-  dual volte does not work in any sim you can use volte only in one sim at a time as you can see in above image.  Notification led-  This phone does not have notification led it is shown as it have notification led in description of product on flipkart.  Battery backup-  Battery backup is average it only lasts half day on minimum usage and it takes 3 and a half-hour to charge up full  Pros-  Grip is awesome in this smartphone it is very easy to carry along.  It has many features such as double tap to wake,sleep  Flip to mute alarm,phone  Put your ear towards phone to accept phone call or put your ear towards phone to go to handset mode from speaker mode  Pick up phone to wake the screen  Net speed-  Net speed and network is best in this device.

4115,"GIONEE Max (Royal Blue, 32 GB)",dr******************,5,Highly recommended,Frankly speaking it is one of the most best budget phone with best of specifications and display and basic functionality at this price point. You can get this features on other phones as well but certainly not at this price. It is can be used for rough and tough purpose an extensive daily uses if you want to keep a second phone.really I do not have much idea about any phone specification and their speed at this price point but I do certainly feel it is really more then what the prices set at. If you are expecting something best within 5000 or 5500 just close your eyes and buy it.  The display is as good as amoled display at this price point. My experience and review is unbiased as I am already using Google pixel 4A and iPhone and iPad pro but at the same time I wanted to to gift my mother in law a budget and a very user friendly phone with big battery but after buying it I was amazed to find that my past Motorola G7 phone and Motorola E4 Plus looks nowhere near it both in functions in speed and price. I liked it so much that I purchased another one for my driver also.  So here is my final outcome and verdict.    The phone working speed is as good as any 10 to 15 thousand priced phone at least far better than G7 Motorola which I purchased last year for 17000 ke but still lags than Gionee Max.  It has a wonderful and speedy face unlock feature which my pixel 4A and even Motorola G7 do not have it.  And not to talk about the battery which is the best part it's a battery beast.  I would give four out of five in camera quality which I am still testing but feel like the pictures are very original real like. And if you can get this phone with cashback on cards it will be extra treat to your pocket also.  And lastly and not the least it is is made in India product.,"Oct, 2020",20,100

4145,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Red, 64 GB)",Va************,5,Excellent Phone! Read My Review.,"If you're in the market for a compact phone with probably the best cameras in a phone today, that does not sacrifice on performance or any of the flagship features then your decision must start and end with an iPhone. First of all Apple has created something that is a throwback to the best smartphones ever designed - the iphone 5 and 5S. While doing so Apple made sure that it did not compromise on power or performance. The 12 mini has all the features (ALL OF THEM!) of the bigger iPhone 12 - so basically its the same A14 processor, same cameras, same RAM, same OLED screen, same FaceID, same wireless charging, same water resistance, same 5G support and everything else! Except that this is a smaller sized phone physically, which is so comfortable to hold that you'll wonder what happened to the smartphone industry getting obsessed over making bigger devices every year.    Fun fact : Literally 8 years ago in 2013 was when the iPhone 5S was announced. That was considered the gold standard in smartphone design. In 8 years we're carrying phones that are getting so uncomfortably big we have forgotten to use them with one hand. You know what's really funny? Human hands have stayed the same size in the last 8 years too. :D    You're not reading this for fun facts. You're really reading this review wondering if the battery life suffers because of the smaller battery on the mini compared to the regular sized iPhone 12. The simple answer - NOT REALLY!. Let me explain. Compared to the regular sized iPhone 12 - you will get ~1.5 hours less in terms of 100% - fully dead battery for the same level of usage on both phones. You can verify this via several YouTube channels that have tested this extensively. So basically for ~1.5 to 2 hours less battery life you get a phone that is so compact, without sacrificing anything else in terms of features. For me personally this means that I love my iPhone 12 mini. Convenience over 2 extra hours of battery life anyday for me. Plus I got a 20W fast charger that charges my mini from 10% - 100% in about ~45 minutes. My phone charges on Apple Carplay while I'm driving too. So 2 less hours of battery life is overrated for me. But you may disagree and that's fine.    Final verdict : If ~1.5 to 2 hours of extra battery backup along with a slightly bigger screen means more for you and how you want to use your phone, buy the regular sized iPhone 12. But for 2 hours less battery backup you prefer the convenience of carrying around a smaller, lighter phone that has everything that the regular 12 has, then buy the 12 mini without a doubt! This is a question of your priorities. ALSO if you're wondering if suddenly typing on a smaller screen will become an issue coming from a bigger phone, you could not be more wrong!

The screen is small and typing might be an issue but after few minutes on you’ll get used to it, the camera and the screen are awesome and the picture quality superb as per my liking. I would recommend a screen protector as minor scratches may occur, which might be caused while cleaning the dust off the phone etc. The price you are paying for a relatively small phone might give you a thought but it’s worth every penny. Light and durable phone and the shape reminds of the older IPhones the 5 & 5s for me which was the best designed iPhone ever regardless of the size",10 months ago,691,2764

4148,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Red, 64 GB)",Vi*******,1,Waste of money!,"Brilliant processor with a tiny battery.    Pro: This phone has the fastest processor in the world.  Con: With a tiny battery & small screen they aren’t pretty useful.    Pro: Supports Dolby Vision HDR Video recording and playback  Con: once you export the video to laptop or pendrive to watch it in big screen, dolby vision disappears from the video and it gets converted to SD. This defeats the whole purpose of having a dolby vision recording facility    Pro: low light photography is really good  Con: Photos no longer look natural. There’s some color correction happening and that makes the photo looks warmer.    Verdict: I purchased this phone considering the pocket friendly size of the phone and A14 chip. It was later I realised that with the tiny battery the phone actually throttles the cpu power. Hence I don’t see any magic happening while editing photos or videos. Export/Rendering time is same as that of iPhone 7 Plus.",6 months ago,196,196

I am a OnePlus 8 user and switched to Poco F3 GT because of its wide screen, and 1B colors AMOLED.    Pros:  1. Widest Phone in market available now  2. Fastest Charger, this is really amazing and no words.  3. Best Display, much better than 50k AMOLED mobiles in market. Comes with HDR 10+ and 10-bit color depth.  4. Video watching is like a feast and you will enjoy this a lot.  5. Weight balance is amazingly done, and you dont feel that weight.    There are but few cons and I am listing them down:    1. Poco should work on their OS still, I feel OnePlus Operating System is far ahead.  2. Although this is 120hz panel, the fluidic feeling is still very less compared to likes of OnePlus and Oppo. Poco should really improve in this area.  2. Some time scrolling feels like hanged (this is definitely software issue), I hope this can be fixed in future.  3. The Poco Control centre (2 swipes left side and right side), is unnecessary and causes lots of confusion to users.  4. Notifications should be given control (gear icon) by their side itself to disable. we need to go inside settings and disable notifications, which is long process.  5. Camera is weak, since there is no OIS. Still images are captured better, but if object is moving and you click it, it will come shaky.",3 months ago,172,688

But honestly man i think under 30k this poco f3 gt is really astonishing and worth every penny.  So I will be telling u the pros and cons of this phone very honestly after 8-9 days of very vigorous usage.  Pros:  1. ultra premium features at this price range of 30k and pretty much matching features with higer range like rog series phone .

4228,"POCO F3 GT (Predator Black, 128 GB)",SI****************,5,Fabulous!,"Great phone for the price. No regrets buying it. If you are not a fan of miui mu mui, follow simple steps shared in YouTube and customise it to simplicity. Camera is not a disappointment, it does the job pretty well. The phone definitely feels premium for the price segment, I have used F1 in the past when it was almost phased out and I feel the aesthetics are improvised. Battery capacity sounds interesting on paper but the juice on offer in actual can be compared to its contenders , anything around 4000+. Initial impression on the maglev keys are tactile, you can set a tone while activating and deactivating it. Funny stuff to try on the first day, however, once when activated you can play it like a f maracas. Hahahah . . I hope the maglev gimmick doesn't disappoint me in the long run. First time on D1200, I have been a fan of SD and the figures are not on par with SD counterpart, but who cares as long as it does what it is intended to do. I faced a temp USB to PC connectivity issue in copying data, it was alternatively connecting and disconnecting, went through a simple tutorial and was able to rectify. The notification lights look fun but if you closely observe the ends on each side doesn't glow to its fullest, it might look odd. But that's how it's supposed to work.hahah. I know it's very early but I am unable to find a branded case. The condm case is fitting well and snuggly but I would prefer something better over it with a good cut out for maglev keys. Doest have NFC, if you haven't used it or don't know what that is, pls look up and fret. I have always used 3-4 finger claws and need to work on my muscle mem to adapt to maglev. 90fps on Pubg is not available but you can expect it to be rolled out soon, I suggest using the config OOTB until it's official . DC dimming work but downgrades the ref rate to 60. Charging the entire brick takes time, close to an hour but I haven't experienced any heating issues so far. So make your omlette on stove. Sound output from speakers is mesmerizing. Dolby is at most on speakers and' 'ok ' on bluetooth, maybe cuz I have a whacked realmine buts q. 5G only 2 bands, if you can afford 5g plans , when govt will materialize it. then cry, don't fret now. Cooling is pretty good, I haven't pushed it to check any therm throttling. Just go for the phone. It should take care of your needs until something good and well within budget shows up. BTW I almost went for Max but I don't regret now. Thank you for your patience in reading this, i should have structured my raw thoughts about the phone. +1 happy user. Tada",3 months ago,77,385

Cons: 1) The major disadvantage in using this Phone I found in the Battery, As Apple has given an official statement of having ""13 hrs of video playback on full charged"" is not true as Battery get drained within 4 hrs of usage, so if you are using a phone for longer duration don't go for this phone.    2) Screen Size 4.7"" seems to be very short as per the cost of the phone. It could be at least 5.3"".    3) Iphone SE has an Heating problem, I don't whether this issue is encountered in every Iphone or not, but in my Phone it is there & phone gets heated very badly in sudden. while having on video call , gaming or while charging.    4) Hotspot is taking atleast 8 to 10 min while connecting it to other systems Wifi or laptop Wifi which is another major cons I observed.","May, 2020",130,390

4322,"APPLE iPhone SE (Red, 128 GB)",Sa*********,3,Iphone SE Budgeted Phone of 2020?,"I have Purchased The new Iphone SE 2020 on 20th May 2020, So based on my usage for a week I can rate the product as follows    * Pros: 1) Display quality seems to be very good.  2) Camera quality is excellent , takes a very sharp images without any blurriness.  3) Touch sensor works very precisely  4) Durability of the phone is good as the quality of body is made of 6000K aluminum which is one of the most durable aluminum in the mobile-industry  5) Speed of the phone is excellent bcz of the latest ""A13 Bionic Processor,"" which is most advanced processor used in Iphone 11.      Cons: 1) The major disadvantage in using this Phone I found in the Battery, As Apple has given an official statement of having ""13 hrs of video playback on full charged"" is not true as Battery get drained within 4 hrs of usage, so if you are using a phone for longer duration don't go for this phone.    2) Screen Size 4.7"" seems to be very short as per the cost of the phone. It could be at least 5.3"".    3) Iphone SE has an Heating problem, I don't whether this issue is encountered in every Iphone or not, but in my Phone it is there & phone gets heated very badly in sudden. while having on video call , gaming or while charging.    4) Hotspot is taking atleast 8 to 10 min while connecting it to other systems Wifi or laptop Wifi which is another major cons I observed.","May, 2020",130,390

Review's are mixed about camera and performance, so I had to take my chance and go for X7 5g. Initially I thought I had made big mistake as being xda developer I know few cons when I see one.    Pictures were so smooth, as I was looking for more sharpness in pics and I was disappointed. Battery backup is excellent I get SOT between 8-9hrs for normal use. Performance I can I was very much satisfied. I had bad experience when I was using mediatek processors few years back. Dimensity is totally different aspect. Slowly I started to realise that I have to live this this camera as rest of the things are pretty excellent.    So I opted for early beta for UI 2.0, after a week I have received update for C0.4 and it changed the phone and it's camera quality to a different whole level. I'm sharing few pics which I took after the update. Guys pixels doesn't matter to take perfect selfie or landscape u just need to capture perfect light and subject.

Here are my Views about this Phone  1. Ergonomics- Weight, Size, Thickness and handfeel are great. Considering the Screen size weight is good and evenly distributed.  2. Battery-Battery is superbly good, long Battery life with powerful fast charging  3. Display - is amoled, bright with good looking screen reproduction color. Touch feel and feedback is great.  4. Camera is Good with limited options but produce good images with slightly over saturated color and blemished skin tone.  5. Speaker and audio quality is not good. Mono speaker feels very basic. Volume is also not loud enough. Did not like at all.  6. Screen is not FHD+ limited to 1080p.  7. Audio quality, Speaker sound, Speaker Volume everything about Sound and audio quality of this phone is simply not good at all.  8. I don't think that a 3.5 mm audio jack may cost so much that a Mobile phone manufacturing company couldn't have afford it. Why is this so? At least a 3.5mm jack should have been provided.  9. Memory is not expandable. And this is really a joke.  10.Health and Fitness app.There is no health and fitness app like Samsung Health for Samsung phones,Huawei Health app with Honor and Huawei Phones. It doesn't even have step counter.    Overall a decent phone with good specs and numbers but not comparable to Honor View10 I was using from last 3 years and didn't ever face a single problem of any kind. Its screen broke unfortunately that's why I had to look for other phone.    So as on date I spent my money for a 5G phone and at this price point the only competitors to this Realme X7 5G is Oneplus nord ce 5G (and is far better than Realme X7 5G) and I made big mistake of choosing Realme over OnePlus just for saving few bucks  (I wish if I could return it and get my refund!!!!!)    If you love listening Music as an audiophile then this phone is not for you (and not for me also) but if you want a 5G phone with Amoled Screen, with a good processor and decent camera the surely go for this (as Honor and Huawei are out of business in India so no competition from them)    Thanks",3 months ago,20,60

Good choice for elders,  Take care of pre loading sim with existinng contacts from old phone.  Only 2 ring tones avaialable.Need more ? pay extra bucks and buy a micro sd card..

4432,DIZO Star 500,Cr************,3,Good at Many Point and Bad at One simple problem,The delivery was speed and good but the feature phone is not good at all    Pro:  1) The build was good  2) Sound quality is excellent  3) design was unique  4) The light strip has a good light quality  5) Camera is not bad at that price point  6) Keypad is also good  7) Display is good  8) Good Battery Life  9) Call recording in feature phone  10) Excellent call quality  11) Wireless fm and recording    Con:  1) There is not enough memory cant take one photo in high quality and cant sent contact above 20 at a time via Bluetooth  2) No option for move contacts from sim to phone or vice verse  3) The contact search bar is very bad when we search for S in the contact list all S will display if the name is Cristo then it will also Display I Think only First letter want to display.  4) By simplifying the contact app need lots more improvement  5) No shortcut key for torch  6) No inbuilt games or application  7) No shortcut key for torch or light strip  8) Very thin back cover ( as it's removable I am mentioning it )  9) No access to internet ( not even in 2g )    If the cons from 1 to 7 was not problem for you then it is the best value for money. I will recommend this for a best feature phone. I think the contact app is the only main cons in the phone if it get update then it will the best feature phone at all.,3 months ago,8,24

Its color emerald green looks really nice.  2. Phone is bit broader since its 20:9 , but it is very light wait , you have to adjust the phone a bit to use it single handedly.  3 . Very very good clean and crisp display.  4. Camera is so far so good. I need to check it in day light and macros. But it has been improved a lot.  5. No Bloatware at all.  6. Battery back up is fine. Fast charge works really well.  8.Side mounted fingerprint se sensor works well.  7.I feel a sense of security while using this phone, I don't need to agree on useless agreements to use any app . I don't have to share any personal info. It's made in India product    Conclusion: it's really better than Smart phones in this range.",1 month ago,369,1845
4530,"MOTOROLA Edge 20 (Frosted Emerald, 128 GB)",Di*************,5,Fabulous!,"This Edge 20 model is based on the Snapdragon 778G 5G chipset, which offers a powerful processor and GPU. It should be enough for smooth HDR gaming, and there is 5G connectivity, too. The Edge 20 Pro is the one with the flagship-grade Snapdragon 870 SoC, but it sure sounds like a bit overkill for a 1080p screen, don't you think?    Anyway, the rear camera of the Edge 20 is thoroughly interesting. It has a 108MP primary snapper with Samsung's ISOCELL HM3 sensor, followed by an 8MP camera with 3x optical zoom and a 16MP ultrawide shooter with autofocus for cool macro photos. The selfies are handled by a front 32MP camera. The Pro model offers 5x zoom instead of 3x, while the Lite model has no tele camera.    The Motorola Edge 20 also shines with 30W fast charging and clean-ish Android 11 with some cool Moto tricks.    Unboxing the Motorola Edge 20  Motorola Edge 20 ships within a thin blue box, which contains a 30W power adapter with a USB-C port and a USB-C cable.    The phone also arrives with a transparent silicone case, and it's already put on for your convenience.",1 month ago,99,495
4531,"MOTOROLA Edge 20 (Frosted Emerald, 128 GB)",Na***********,5,Classy product,"The best Android till date in the price segment .  1. Call reception, haptics , Carrier aggregation works very well. Recieving 62 Mbps( 6 MBPS) on full network.  2. Very well managed weight, very light and slim.  3. Display is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.  4. Battery is also well managed due to 6nm processor. 6 hours SOT with 144 hz, mobile data on, light gaming and SM.  5. Geekbench score : 760 single, 2604 multi. Fairly above Snapdragon 855+.  6. Telephoto is love.  7. Wired earphones with type-c to 3.5 mm convertor work great.  8. Decent amount of customisation with icons as well as useful Moto features like chop chop for flash.  9. Ready for PC is very handy thing.  9. UI is the smoothest u can get. No creepy apps.  A simple snappy nd secure device.  A huge shout to motorola for making this almost flagship killer product.    Cons:  1. Speakers are loud,crispy with ample bass but not as loud as stereo speakers.  2. Netflix not supporting HDR, 10 bit colour streaming. Don't know if it's motorola or Netflix.

4532,"MOTOROLA Edge 20 (Frosted Emerald, 128 GB)",Ro***,3,Fair,"Overall a decent stock Android smartphone. Getting straight to the pros and cons:  Pros:  1) Close to stock Android experience  2) Good performance, thanks to SD778 and 8GB RAM  3) 30W fast charging does the job in close to an hour  4) Great OLED display  5) Refresh rate of 144 Hz is a pleasant experience, which is short lived, which leads to the cons.    Cons:  1) Battery provide is a victim of cost cutting. Seriously, 4000mAh for a big display and 144Hz? The pleasant experience is short lived. You will have to plug in by the end of 12 hrs under normal usage.  2) Most important: The WiFi antenna reception seems to have degraded compared to my 4yr old moto g5 plus. Frequent disconnections was observed. Also the cellular antenna reception too is not improved, considering the price point, it should have.  3) Camera could have been better. Atleast considering the size of the camera module that is weirdly projecting off the phone's body.    VERDICT:  Phone has decent specs but hardly meets the basics.    NOW WHO SHOULD CONSIDER BUYING THIS PHONE:  People who are ONLY looking for stock Android experience(over Chinese phones crapware loaded UI) with decent performance and display within 20k-30k range. Simply because, you have no other options during this chip shortage crisis! LOL  And Nokia is busy making phones with low end SD chips, Asus is favouring upper class gamers, and Google doesn't care about launching smartphones in India anymore.

Light weight easy to handle but people with littles fingers might find it tad difficult to reach top of the screen.  In the camera department, night vision should be improved.  I used moto x4 for 4 years and I love the software experience with no unwanted junk.

Streaming playback is not available in Full HD for some reason, but YouTube works good. Camera is just about good, but not dependable. Is sufficient for those who want to take photos occasionally. Pro mode helps a bit, but still needs improvement. Overall performance, battery backup, UI and build quality are top notch.

Camera ok, at night, produces grains, otherwise at well light area, captures good photos. Ultra macro is not so effective. Expected a little bit more better results.  Battery lasts upto 1 day, takes 1hr to charge from 5% to 100%, I didn't understand why they calling it super dart charging, as same time is taken by my previous Moto G5 Plus. Expected a little bit high battery life.    Display is nice, super amoled screen is vivid and very responsive.    Performance is good, although,yet, I haven't played any game on this phone.    No slot for 3.5 mm jack and no provision of inserting extra memory card, if you run out of storage, you have to take back-up of all files and clear the storage to make rooms for extra files.    So, for me it's ok. I loved it. At this price segment, other brand doesn't offer such configuration. But, you must think about your requirements before buying it.

Decent camera, great looks, great battery and charging.    Design:Looks great and classy due to gorilla glass at back. camera bump is slightly bigger but this issue can fixed by using cover. Phone is slightly bigger.    Display:It has 6.67inch ips lcs display. Viewing angles are good has Decent brightness. There is screen bleeding around camera cutout and edges of display but not a big deal every lcd djisplay has screen bleeding and can be solved by using dark mode.    Camera:Forget about megapixels it has Decent camera. back camera is good video quality is also good u can record video in 4k. macro camera is great.  But front camera is not that great I don't know why it makes faces yellowish. hope it will be resolved in future updates.    Battery and charging: Best in this price segment can be used for 2 days in normal usage. It takes 1:20-25 min to full charge,above 58%in 30 min,85%in 1 hour. For me it's battery and charger was deal breaker.    Performance:it has Snapdragon's 720g. Great performance. But I saw some lags in the UI which can be solved in future updates. I didn't played pubg but I played some games no heating issue at all.    Speaker: nice speaker. Vocals are clear and has Decent loudness    Final verdict: I think it's best phone in this price point. U can opt this over realme 6 only realme 6's camera is better than this.    Deducted one star due to its privacy issues. Clean master is still there.    Hope it is helpfull.

4652,"realme Narzo 30 Pro 5G (Blade Silver, 128 GB)",Na*****,4,Cheapest 5G phone with Decent Features and Configuration,"There are very few options in the market for 5G phones at present and none of them come close to Realme Narzo 30 Pro 5G in terms of value for money. Someone who normally uses their phone for at least 3 to 5 years this is a good option. 5G might be rolled out in a year or so and this phone will get one covered for 5G connectivity as it supports up to five different 5G bands which is the second best after Moto G 5G at present.    Design and Build:  The design of this phone is simple and elegant. Its not too loud and attention grabbing. The subtle design of the phone makes it feel premium and upmarket without any large branding or letters on the back. The body is a polycarbonate shell without any metal inserts. This makes the phone thin, light and very comfortable to hold in hand as well as slip inside the pocket. The backside has a matte finish thereby reducing fingerprint smudges. The transparent body cover provided with the phone is of good quality and covers all the ports nicely. The rear camera housing isn't too protruding thereby reducing phone wobble when placed on a flat surface.    Display:  The display is a very good quality 6.5 inch IPS LCD panel with Full HD resolution. It comes with a butter smooth 120hz refresh rate. The peak brightness is a respectable 600 nits that makes it legible in outdoor bright sunlight. There is an average size chin at the bottom and the bezels are well within limits. Being an IPS LCD panel there is screen bleeding at the edges. It would have been great of Realme had provided a full HD OLED panel at this price, nevertheless the IPS LCD panel used in this phone is of a very good quality.    Performance:  The phone comes equipped with the powerful Mediatek Dimensity 800U processor using 7nm technology which has an inbuilt 5G modem. It feels powerful enough to carry out day to day tasks like browsing, streaming videos, watching videos and using various apps. There wasn't a single instance of phone hanging or freezing at any time. Gaming performance is respectable too and it does not heat up much. Although I feel there is some more optimization needed for the Dimensity 800U processor for gaming. The Antutu and Geekbench scores for this processor are decent. The RAM management is decent too. There were no issues in network connectivity either and I was getting 4G+ indicating it has carrier aggregation. All in all a good performer at this price point.    Camera:  It comes equipped with a triple camera setup with a 48MP main camera, 8MP ultrawide and 2MP Macro camera. The main camera does a decent job but not too exceptional. The 8 MP ultrawide too does a decent job and the output is above average. The 2MP macro isn't anything to write about. Front selfie camera is 16MP and does a good job. The overall quality of output from the Main and Ultrawide camera will not disappoint but given the price Realme should have provided better cameras compared to the competition. If you are camera lover look elsewhere.    Battery:  The battery life is good enough for one and a half to two days under normal usage. It comes with a good 30W Dart charger that charges the phone from 0 to 100% in 70 mins. approximately.    UI:  This phone disappointingly comes with Android 10 out of the box although Realme has promised Android 11 update soon. The Realme UI is lighter and faster compared to the competition, may I say closer to stock android experience. The dark mode works like charm and bumps up the battery life even further. It comes loaded with bloatware most of which can be uninstalled but some annoying apps cannot be uninstalled. Hence one star less for this phone.    Verdict:  You can consider this phone if you need a future proof phone and your current phone is on the verge of dying or unusable. Don't buy it just for the heck of it or because it has 5G. Competition offers better specifications and configuration at this price (but without 5G).",7 months ago,41,164

It has been about 1 month, and here's my take on Realme Narzo 30 pro 5g - 6gb RAM 64 gb ROM segment:  • A powerful battery life, runs for around 2 days as a normal user (watch videos, text, surf the web) after one time charge(not a gamer) (5000 mAh)  • Charging is exceptionally fast😳 0 to 100% in 1 hour 10 mins!!! (30W dart charging)  •Display is very good, and very bright even in sunlight conditions. It's automatic brightness recognition is very efficient but sometimes gives a very bright screen so I tend to turn off automatic brightness if I am not outside.  •Very, very fast and fluid touch response  • Camera is decent, I am not a professional mobile photographer. Sunlight photos are great, selfies are good without the AI recognition and beauty enhancement and low-light is average. It has ultrawide and ultra macro which both take good photos.  • they provide a case, and I didn't hesitate to use it. It fits very snugly and is comfortable to hold  •phone is lightweight!  •they also provide already attached screen guard on the phone which was very nice to see.  • Flashlight is of good quality as well.

This is a budget 5G mobile which has great features. Realme UI is very user friendly with lots of gestures.

4676,"realme Narzo 30 Pro 5G (Sword Black, 128 GB)",MR*************,3,Nice,Realme Narzo 30Pro 5G is good on performance and battery which is want I wanted.Speaker sound is amazing But disappointed when it comes to hearing on headphones which I requires improvement particularly with bass effects on phone.  Had slight issues with Vdo calling had to install Jio app but it got sorted out.  Hotspot connection is crisp.  Those who like performance should go for it considering price and future ready phone when 5G starts.  If looking for 2 to 3 years go for this one as others range beyond 17K to 30K.  Personally I always feel to go with a phone with requirement you have and after 2- 3 years go for new one.Smartphone and features keep on changing every few months.  Do your analysis also before you go for it.,5 months ago,84,252
4677,"realme Narzo 30 Pro 5G (Blade Silver, 64 GB)",Ra********,5,Excellent,"My first phone, and an amazing one at that!  It has been about 1 month, and here's my take on Realme Narzo 30 pro 5g - 6gb RAM 64 gb ROM segment:  • A powerful battery life, runs for around 2 days as a normal user (watch videos, text, surf the web) after one time charge(not a gamer) (5000 mAh)  • Charging is exceptionally fast😳 0 to 100% in 1 hour 10 mins!!! (30W dart charging)  •Display is very good, and very bright even in sunlight conditions. It's automatic brightness recognition is very efficient but sometimes gives a very bright screen so I tend to turn off automatic brightness if I am not outside.  •Very, very fast and fluid touch response  • Camera is decent, I am not a professional mobile photographer. Sunlight photos are great, selfies are good without the AI recognition and beauty enhancement and low-light is average. It has ultrawide and ultra macro which both take good photos.  • they provide a case, and I didn't hesitate to use it. It fits very snugly and is comfortable to hold  •phone is lightweight!  •they also provide already attached screen guard on the phone which was very nice to see.  • Flashlight is of good quality as well.

I really like the realme ui. But I would have been better if Android 11. The camera needs lot of improvement. It saturates all images. None of the images I have uploaded have original colors.

If they add sAmoled screen also, the phone will be the best at this price range. But overall the phone's performance is good 🙂. And you will love it's Blade silver colour it looks very premium. They should give 64 MP camera at rear as 48 MP is available is lesser price range. But the front camera is very good. I suggest if you need better camera and better screen you should buy Realme X7 and If you need a fast refresh rate display with battery you can opt to Narzo.

The phone comes with a screen protector attached inside the box which is a very nice thing that you don't have to hurry to the market to buy one.

4690,"POCO M3 Pro 5G (Yellow, 64 GB)",SH*******,5,Highly recommended,"It is a good budget 5G phone. I loved it. Good performance is giving out from dimensity 700🔥🔥.  The mediatek dimensity 700 give a performance equalent to Snapdragon 732G in gaming. Almost the two processor Antu Antu score is almost equal.But one of disadvantages of mediatek is game optimization is less compared to Snapdragon. In future the app developer of games will fix this issue. My complete review is down here👇      1.👉 Good performance at this price range  2. 👉Good battery backup it last more than one day. I got screen on time upto 10hrs  3.👉90hz display is good and it is very smooth. It's automatically dynamic refresh rate switching features is very good, we don't have to change manually in settings while gaming.  4. 👉360 degree proximity sensor is very good.  5. 👉5G connectivity, is very good. Almost all 5G band are offering in mediatek dimensity 700. In dimensity 800U not all bands available which is in the dimensity 700.  6.👉18w fast charging is there, it take maximum 2hrs to full charge. But my suggestion is that they have to include 33W fast charging like in poco m2 pro. Due to 5G, they don't provide that😭.  7.👉The Poco M3 Pro has a high-res main camera. It relies on a 48MP OmniVision OV48B 1/2"" sensor with 0.8µm pixels, Quad-Bayer filter and PDAF. The lens is 26mm f/1.8. Night Mode is available on this imager.  The macro camera uses a 2MP Hynix Hi-259 sensor with large 1.75µm pixels. The lens is f/2.4, while the focus is fixed at about 4cm-5cm distance.    The third shooter at the back is a 2MP GalaxyCore GC02M1B monochrome depth sensor.    The selfie camera uses an 8MP OmniVision OV8856 1/4"" sensor with 1.12µm pixels. It sits behind an f/2.0 lens, and the focus is fixed.  8.👉 It offers UFS 2.2 storage which is 10 times better than UFS 2.1.  9.👉 The mobile phone is design is very attractive and stylish 🔥😍😍  10.👉 Dual tone flashlight is very good feature.          Overall good phone........ Just go for it. If you prefer in camera I don't recommend this, because camera quality is not better. Overall good phone. Main thing is performance which is very good at this price range.",4 months ago,275,1375

Sound is very good, quiet loud, the speakers are of very decent quality.  Display is fine.  Rear Camera is good, produces decent pictures in daylight but there is some softness in the low light mode. Front camera also performs good in daylight mode....but in low light, it struggles to produce a decent picture. Camera AI is not up to the mark. It needs some upgradation.  The cell phone feels a bit heavy to me.  No bloatwares.  Does not come with any backcover.  Charging is very quick as it comes with a 20W Type C charger.  Face unlock is quick but I would not recomend you to use the face unlock as it unlocks even if your eyes are closed. Hence, anyone can easily unlock your phone while you are asleep.  Fingerprint sensor is good. Works fine.  This phone is not meant for high end gaming, so avoid this if you r a gamer.    Overall, at this price range, I personally feel that the phone is worth buying. Actually, I was bit confused whether to buy Samsung M12 or Moto G10 Power, as both comes with almost same specifications. I chose Moto and I don't regret buying it.",7 months ago,2117,10585
4838,"MOTOROLA G10 Power (Aurora Grey, 64 GB)",Hi*************,5,Awesome,"The phone is no doubt best in this budget if you want to experience pure stock android . Earlier I was thinking to buy poco / Xiaomi smartphone (at the time of purchase I was using redmi 4 ) but then somewhere in my heart I wanted to get out of that buggy bloated MIUI with so many ads (as a Xiaomi user myself ) . I have used Motorola smartphones before I got redmi 4 , so I thought to again buy a Motorola smartphone and I'm happy to say that it was the best choice.    I don't regret my decision at all.    1.It's camera is perfect according to this budget.  2. Absolutely loved it's back design although it is plastic but it comes with Matt finish due to which it doesn't catchs any fingerprints and smudges which is a good thing and it also feels premium.    3. Amazing battery life , in my usage it easily lasts for 2 days maybe more than that and I am a average user.    5. Speaker are decently loud.    And yes I forgot to mention Motorola gestures . These were another reason why I purchased Motorola g10 power.  They are so much helpful.    I love this purchase .    I am writing this review after using this smartphone for more than 20 days.",7 months ago,1572,7860
4839,"MOTOROLA G10 Power (Aurora Grey, 64 GB)",Ni************,4,Very Good,I got the phone on 18th of March and delivery is quiet decent  Coming towards phone review    1. Battery is long lasting and for normal users it lasts long upto 2 days without charge but if you are heavy user like me then you can get disappointed.  2. Camera rear and front both not really upto specially front camera so I''m disappointed but rear one is still good clicks decent pictures.  3. Processor is also quiet powerful as I am game lover and played free fire it's very smooth going and handles multitasking without lagging also does not heat despite such heavy usage.  4. Software is pure also not like other phones using their unnecessary UI for some rubbish reason  5. Lastly as I'm a moto user so kept this legacy carry forward got disappointed with camera but Its a quiet satisfying deal.  6.Sometimes some apps crashes.  7.Rating 4/5.

Same goes for fast charging. I use the phone all day on a single charge. If I game, it takes about 2 charges to last a day. Moving from SD450 to G95, so I'm actually happy.  Low light selfies aren't that great, but low light pictures on rear camera are excellent. Loving the great AMOLED display.

Camera is extremely good with lot of feature pro mode is nice raw is here but no wide angle support. night mode is good but not the best. Video quality is good 4k 60fps on main and 1080p on ultra wide. OIS works good on rear camera. Low light video could be better . Portrait Mode is excellent works good in low light too. Macro is sharp you just need perfect light  8. Main focus on this phone is selfie. 1st time i am satisfied with the front camera in my 1st impression. Low light photos are better than S21 ultra. Portrait mode is amazing and video is sharp with 4k. Night mode is also here with lot of filters and effect.    Only thing to concern is processor else everything is excellent.

Under screen fingerprint sensor is quite responsive.  Front camera is good. Front flash is quite effective and you can take selfies even in dark.    Things i didn't like  Vivo apps cannot be Uninstalled and many cannot be disabled.  Not for intensive games.  In my old phones when power was running out and phone was abou to switch off, I would get a warning. No such warning in this. Just goes off.

But it should be higher than this  may be (DIMENSITY 1000 or 1200) should be better at this price range.  But never mind it performance is good but not so good for gamers. Beside this FUN TOUCH OS is very nicely optimised. I am very happy to see this performance.  *CONS - BATTERY is 4000 mAh only. It should be little bit higher. But still E3 AMOLED display and the 7 nm processor are battery efficient. So the battery consumption is very low even in full brightness and heavy usage. Overall I loved it. Only i want is a good processor higer than 800 U will be good.

5032,"Google Pixel 4a (Just Black, 128 GB)",AB*************,5,Classy product,"I am super glad to mention that I got the opportunity to buy this cute yet performer phone. This is an unbiased review even though I had to struggle alot in buying it as it wasn't easily available in the initial days of sales. Let's start.  What I like -  1) It's compact. It's very small and handy yet sports a 5.8"" screen. Which will suffice your media consumption.    2)Display is oled so you inherently get the perks of deep contrasts. Considering the price, it definitely is at par with the devices in this range.    3)Processor is more than enough if you're not a pro gamer and every other task feels smooth and snappy.    4) clean vanilla os from the house of Google itself.    5) Google has taken care of every small details like haptics feedback(that's insane), microphone(a quality one), speakers(got bass, crisp and pretty loud), minimalistic design and what not.  which makes it even better than it's competition.    No complaints regarding charging as it supports 18w and battery isn't that big (3000mah) so it does the job without much waiting.  Charges @3000 milli amperes(comes down after reaching 80%) and remains constant. Moreover doesn't heat much.    Conclusion -  Maybe a little overpriced. Mark my word ""little"" and that too only when you will compare it with other Chinese competing companies and this phone shouldn't be compared with such companies coz they will just lure you into buying cheap Chinese stuff by giving big numbers yet when it comes to daily usage they Just give up.    Overall, it's a great purchase and I'll keep updating the review. Hope it helps you all. Go for it.  UPDATE 1-it's been more than 2.5 months and it's still going great. Although I don't use cover and tempered glass yet nothing happened to phone after falling from a decent height. I'll keep updating.  Update 2- now it's been over 4months and the device is still impressive as new with no issues. Fyi it has fallen twice without any protection yet it's going great without any significant damage.","Oct, 2020",1638,8190

It handles dynamic range pretty well. See the attached pictures you will have an idea 😊  2) Performance - Even though it doesn't have flagship internals, phone feels fast and snappy.. thanks to android 11.. animations have become better so it feels butter smooth as of now  3) Haptic feedback - The best you will get in this price range!!!  4) Battery - I have to say that google has optimised this device superbly!!! I was able to get 5 to 6 hours of SOT consistently  5) Display - It's OLED panel, so no complaints here! Loving it!  6) Speakers: It can get pretty loud!  6) Cellular reception: I haven't faced any call drop! Network coverage is great! eSim works fine!    There is nothing like I hate about this device but I have some points which could have been better!  1) Colors on this OLED panel is too warm for my liking, I would have loved to see cooler tones!  2) It takes around 100 mins to get fully charged, so I feel charging speed could have been better!

I didn't want 3-4 cameras on my phone, I rather just wanted one quality one, and it has an amazing camera. I'm not a fan of wireless earphones, airpods etc as I don't have time to charge my earphones as well, I rather love the old fashioned wired earphones and it has a earphone jack. I was also not craving face recognition etc and I'm more than okay with just pin lock or fingerprint sensor. It has a smooth and simple interface and a good battery life. The battery would easily last for more than a whole day if you are not someone who is constantly glued to his phone. Overall I got what I wanted (a quality non Chinese phone) and I'm satisfied.

From my experience I would say this phone is one of the worst product ever from Samsung. Never go for this product. 2010's 2 magapixal nokia phone cameras were far far better than this phone camera. Also the phone is very slow. Very less features are being integrated with this phone. The battery hardly last upto 12-18 hours for normal internet surfing and calls. I urge samsung should stop such product. Definitely this will spoil the Samsung reputation. I personally never go for any Samsung product.

I was using one plus 5 and after so much recommendations from my friends, I finally decided to go for Samsung after 10-15 years or so, but earlier decisions were better.. totally unhappy with the touch ,sometimes it's ultra sensitive and sometimes it's totally unresponsive.    No fast charging . Whatever Samsung claims but it takes life time for complete charging.    No use of Samsung apps and app store..such a waste of memory ..    Weight of the mobile is too much .. if you are on long phone calls than u have no other option rather than using headphone ..    Overall totally disappointed.. next time will be going for one plus or any other but not Samsung ..    After using it for 1 month , some things r definitely not worth like the weight, it's enormous ..u can't put it on mobile holder in car,as no mobile holder is strong enough, it continuously fells off the same .. fast charging is a myth . Today it took 90 min to charge the cell from 15% to 73%..that too when in switched of condition ,otherwise it takes ages to charge fully ... so it was my worst decision to switch to Samsung from one plus ..",2 months ago,8,8

Full HD+ screen is very bright and Colors are accurate and crisp.  2) glass back feels premium.  3) notch is very tiny, it looks nice but as of now while writing this review miui has no option to hide the notch yet. I know many people would like to disable the notch. In future through software update may be Xiaomi would fix this.  4) sound quality is okay. not great and not bad.  5) software : Android pie out of the box with miui 10.  6) security patch level is of 5-1-2019 out of the box.  7) The in box cover is okay type but I would recommend buy a proper case very soon. The one in the box will not give proper protection.  8) headset: The headphone output is very good I would say.  9) Network: volte for my jio and Airtel working great. Call experiences great too.  10)*advertisements*: make sure you disable every ""receive recommendation* option in system application section so that you don't see advertisements.  11) camera:see the photo's yourself( shot on gcam) I have not edited them. photo's are simply outstanding with gcam even with the nightmode. don't trust every Youtubers who are just biased with brands and models.  note * the are many gcam versions *  12) charging: it takes about 2hours to go full charge. 0-60 percentage takes about 40mins.  *type c* cable makes it more of a modern device.  lastly go for it guys it's a value for money device.  this device looks and feels such premium.  ****Lastly battery life... it is decent, will last a day or two easily. *****  *Go for it*","Mar, 2019",1504,7520

Device build is nice although front and back are gorilla glass protected and side bezels are plastic but not feels like plastic. Preinstalled camera app is garbage, Camera is excellent only if you use gcam port of pixel 3 xl, working perfectly for me. Display is bright and vibrant but in sunlight reflection is very high. Performance is very good because of good processor pubg run smooth but 3gb ram causing problems and performance is decreasing because of 3gb ram and framedrops can seen clearly so install few apps for smooth pubg experience. Speaker is descent but calling speaker of front is not that loud. Battery lasts for one day easily, and also type c fast charge and hybrid slot is there. Finally overall nice device to use everything is fine for light use but if you are hard user then ram is not sufficient only few apps run at a time, so go for 4gb instead of 3gb ram.

First of all the phone looks quite premium with minimal bezels and sleek design. It's little bit slippery also. Phone boots quite fast.  Though I am not a fan of MIUI but still it gets the job done.  Camera takes very nice pictures, though I didnt like the portrait mode much.  Didn't test the battery, but as per specs it should easily last a day and half on moderate usage.  The display is above 6'' and the quality is crystal clear.  You will get a 5V 2Amp normal charger and a case.  Nothing to say about the processor. It will play ping in HD graphics easily.  Now the only con that I found is the heating issue, as soon as I got it, I put it on charge. The phone was in switch off mode but it still heated, not much but it did heat a little and the charger heated also. So after all these pros, I found a con and that may get resolved by some future update.  thanks for reading","Mar, 2019",63,252

Tried by disabling and enabling mobile network and all the possibilities, mobile internet didn't work at all, but was able to make a call at the same time.    Solution: Rebooted the mobile, then 4G directly coming and able to browse without any issue.    2. Kept my phone not used for long time say, 2-4 hours ( I. e. No incoming and outgoing call was made from/to), then tried to call any number, the call was getting ended directly with in few seconds.    Tried all possibilities under SIM settings, nothing worked out. Note, was able to receive incoming call at the same time.    I give single star⭐ because camera and battery back up are good, after all I give importance to call which is needed for an emergency.

The first few minutes, I get 60 fps in battle royale games like CODM and PUBGM. But after a while, I get around 15 fps and major frame drops. The camera and display are both great. Same goes for fast charging. I use the phone all day on a single charge. If I game, it takes about 2 charges to last a day. Moving from SD450 to G95, so I'm actually happy.  Low light selfies aren't that great, but low light pictures on rear camera are excellent. Loving the great AMOLED display.

I am satisfied with overall phone however without reason my phone restarted 2 times and on 2nd time it was freezed with Samsung on screen. As I am tech savy I pressed volume key up+ down + Power button to complete shut down. It turned off and I rebooted and it works fine. I request that Samsung should release phone update with the fix.    -Display is very good. People are stupid to compare it with SuperAmoloid.. They should know that Super Amoloid doesnot show real colour. It show -over exaggerated color. This phone has PLS display but color is awesome.  -No issues while working on any apps.  -Battery is perfect. I watch video and use it a lot however I got more than 36 hours of backup. It has 15% battery so I put it into charger.  -Little bulky  -Appearance is good and feels adorable while holding on hands.  -Network is awesome. I had Aluminium body phone it has network issue but this one is very good. It works good with WiFi and on 4G also.    Overall the phone is Awesome.

And the display is absolutely the worst. It is not at all a powerful phone. It cannot record Instagram videos without lagging. Camera isnt that great on low light. Note that there is no timelapse. No slow motion. Nothing basically. The only good thing about this phone is the battery. But also, considering the price range, I think we can get better android phones with the basic latest features at least, or even one with a better display. And especially if you have used an iphone before and you want to try a cheap samsung phone, this is a big no no. It's been a real disappointment. Did not expect this from Samsung.","Oct, 2020",40,40

(Actual viewable area is less due to the rounded corners and the camera cutout.)other than display is awesome.  Camera- macro cam is excellent, 48 mp main cam is sup at night also.  Battery-now a days what ever brand is the main feature is battery life , for this mid range mobile A21S giving awesome powerback experience the people who need good camera , performance and battery life this mobile is good. Because third party company's tested this mobile to give awesome battery experience .and Rated (minimum) capacity is 4,900 mAh. Actual battery life may vary depending on network environment, usage patterns and other factors.  Coming to performance side give a little bit disappointment for gamers , for normal use (less graphical games) performance is excellent, for pubg this range mobile is excellent but using long time little bit disappointment. Other than all are good. I fully satisfied @battery backup , @camera and @performance. Thank you samsung& flipcart . actually this is my second samsung handset years back i buy Galaxy variant but unfortunately that is Korean peace that I think that I never buy samsung , but after my friend suggested to that buy original product you get awesome experience so again i buy this product, now i am fully happy and changed my desition about samsung.

Since you all know this is all about camera smartphone. The camera is simply awesome and actually does the job as claimed by the brand. Few attached images for reference. Still if you have any doubt, I would suggest you to visit your nearby stores to check yourself.  Now apart from camera the processor is not very powerful but it is very stable and can handle almost everything.  This is NOT a GAMING SMARTPHONE. However, I have played cod and asphalt 8&9 on max settings and it runs very smoothly. I do play games but am not a hardcore gamer.  The OS is good and is highly customisable.  The charger is fast and does the job perfectly.  And lastly, one will get amazed with the design of the smartphone, it really feels premium.    I can surely recommend this smartphone to the people who are NOT hardcore gamers and want a premium smartphone which will do all the daily tasks very fast and smoothly with a good battery life and an exceptional camera.

5476,"vivo X70 Pro (Cosmic Black, 256 GB)",kr*****,5,Fabulous!,"I am a V20 user for a year.  Comes to the x70 pro, Fairly good job done by the vivo in the camera and display department especially but I feel it's not upto the mark and hype that vivo advertised.    What I really observed in the first impression is ,the photos comes out is not atleast the level of V20 in stable shots,why I mentioned that v20 was not OIS one,but pics are pleasent and usable.    X70 pro pics are over saturated and some color quantization is there and not useful after from the mobile.  Here the display was good,so u get some good quality when viewing from that but when input those to big displays ,u will see the difference clearly and V20 wins here.  Pictures are oversaturated,not natural ones.  This time I am disappointed with vivo.    Battery is quite decent enough and is truly depends on ur usage stats.  Processing power was not upto the mark.    Basically I am just a user to go out for photography mostly for my best ones and the samples attached here straight out from the camera.U may have idea what exactly this phone do.  I am doing browsing,banking and photography with this .  Not recommended when comes to the photography needs,best to buy V series or others and u won't disappoint either.    Selfie camera was too worst.    Pros:  Display  Battery  Photography options  Form factor        Cons:  Processor  cameras or software      This review was described as per my knowledge,may others can see better.

Black color looks more punchy like amoled display .  • Camera is very premium and captures decent pictures in both indoor and outdoor . Low light images are also very good in clarity with very few distortion . Front selfie camera as well take good pictures with lot of available customization .  • As loaded with SD712 the performance of is very smooth. Pubg runs quite well without any major shutters in HD and high setting . Fortnite is also supported. Ram management is also very effective .    • vooc charging is very fast and charges from 0 to 50 in just 30 minutes and for full charging takes about 1 hour 10 minutes      • Finger print unlock is very fast and face unlock also works decent with many apps also .    • Build quality is excellent with decent diamond cut design. Dedicated SD card slot provided for expanding the storage .    Cons: • battery backup is good but not excellent more battery optimization is required via software updates .  • No notification light , not an major issue but still  it would be more preferable with notification led .","Sep, 2019",48,240

Like, very. And the display is absolutely the worst. It is not at all a powerful phone. It cannot record Instagram videos without lagging. Camera isnt that great on low light. Note that there is no timelapse. No slow motion. Nothing basically. The only good thing about this phone is the battery. But also, considering the price range, I think we can get better android phones with the basic latest features at least, or even one with a better display. And especially if you have used an iphone before and you want to try a cheap samsung phone, this is a big no no. It's been a real disappointment. Did not expect this from Samsung.","Oct, 2020",40,40

(Actual viewable area is less due to the rounded corners and the camera cutout.)other than display is awesome.  Camera- macro cam is excellent, 48 mp main cam is sup at night also.  Battery-now a days what ever brand is the main feature is battery life , for this mid range mobile A21S giving awesome powerback experience the people who need good camera , performance and battery life this mobile is good. Because third party company's tested this mobile to give awesome battery experience .and Rated (minimum) capacity is 4,900 mAh. Actual battery life may vary depending on network environment, usage patterns and other factors.  Coming to performance side give a little bit disappointment for gamers , for normal use (less graphical games) performance is excellent, for pubg this range mobile is excellent but using long time little bit disappointment. Other than all are good. I fully satisfied @battery backup , @camera and @performance. Thank you samsung& flipcart . actually this is my second samsung handset years back i buy Galaxy variant but unfortunately that is Korean peace that I think that I never buy samsung , but after my friend suggested to that buy original product you get awesome experience so again i buy this product, now i am fully happy and changed my desition about samsung.

Beside this FUN TOUCH OS is very nicely optimised. I am very happy to see this performance.  *CONS - BATTERY is 4000 mAh only. It should be little bit higher. But still E3 AMOLED display and the 7 nm processor are battery efficient. So the battery consumption is very low even in full brightness and heavy usage. Overall I loved it.

5797,"SAMSUNG Galaxy M31s (Mirage Black, 128 GB)",Ba****************,5,A very complete product.,"Good Phone. Great considering the price. Apart from refresh rate, doesn't feel much different modern day flagships.    Design is just right, subtle yet flamboyant . Light polycarbonate but still manages to look like metal. Not heavy, nice form factor - almost bessel free too.  Display is one of the best I've ever seen. Color mode: Vivid. Tone: Warm. Looks like a charm!  Primary camera is quite good both in sun and low light. Different modes yet to test. Camera is AI enabled - even an amateur will capture legendary shots with it's suggestions. 😉  Processor does not lag once the phone is fully set up internally (which takes a couple of hours if you smart switch from your old samsung). Before that is heats up and struggles a bit.  Knox is there and got secure folder after updating the software - unlike what many youtubers say.  Sound is rich with good amounts of bass and clarity, but it does crack a bit at the highest volume.  All in all, a very satisfying purchase to be frank.",9 months ago,624,3120

5801,"SAMSUNG Galaxy M31s (Mirage Black, 128 GB)",sa************,5,Awesome,"Actually my purchase is completely tragic.And it was done on 21/06/21  I was planning to buy for a budget of 15k but somehow when I thought about not purchasing any chinese produced or chinese brand to be very frank then it comes down to samsung and well this phone was launced last year and well with exynos 9611 which is quite an old processor but significant too.  Now when I saw all about this phone I was quite impressed not with specs but with what I need personally and this phone was offering all of it which are : Top priority- An FHD super Amoled display, good battery(6000 is more than good 😂😂), Fast charging, good camera and a decent processor because I donot game heavily just sometimes here and there and it offered me all.  Okay coming to the phone:  # Pros-  1. Indian manufactured ( In New Delhi facility)  2. SuperAmoled Display ( Trust me no one makes amoled displays better than samsung)  3. Big Battery (6000mAh) last easily for 1-1.5 days for me.  4. 25 W fast charging (It works quite well as compared to average 15W).  5. One UI- It is optimised and very close to no bloatware.  6. Infinity O notch which I literally forget sometimes is there.  7. Dolby Atmos support, Wi-fi calling, dual band wifi... everything I need.  8. I forgot to add camera..Well it works great. I have added some photos for your reference or you can go to a YouTuber too if you have planned this particular phone.  9. For BGMI(GAMERS 😉 it plays it like butter smooth with extreme and it can go upto HDR).    #Cons-  1. Back is a fingerprint magnet( You'll have to use a skin or back cover).  2. As of now I have just found nothing else 🥲.    Verdict:  As I have decided to never buy phones from chinese vendors hence Samsung is all I planned for. If you are looking for a phone which is balanced and gives you everything but for a premium price then trust me go without any hesitation. Samsung is a well established brand and never plays shaddy tricks to make users buy another new phone.",4 months ago,55,275

First of all, I want to tell you that, I am not a hard core gamer and I am using this phone mainly for multitasking like social media usage, watching movies and listening music and my study purposes. So I don't know much about the gaming performance of this device.    1) Build  This phone is very handy. When I am choosing a phone one of my major priority is compactness. In that case I am very satisfied with this device. Build quality is also good, not feel as a cheaper plastic material.    2) Display  This is the gorgeous part of this phone. Every time I unlock the phone and look at it's display my mind will say unknowingly ""wow"". it's one of the best crystal clear display that I am used ever to. Very useful for multimedia purposes. 120Hz refresh rate also help to increase smoothness.    3) Speakers  The sound quality is amazing. The dual speakers doing a great job.    4) Network  The phone impressed me lot in the case of internet speed and call quality. I am struggling with the network speed inside my house for more than a year with my previous device (OnePlus 5). My family members still struggling with the network speed. But after buying this phone I never phase a speed reduction problem or any kind of network issue anywhere inside my house. Superfast network due to carrier aggregation technology.    5) Camera  This is the main drawback of this device. The camera quality is average. You should get better images when using Google cam. But not much difference. Especially the performance of the front camera is not upto the mark. I didn't feel it as a disadvantage because I don't care much about the camera.    6) Realme UI  Previously I am an Oxygen OS user and also a big fan of Oxygen OS. Because it contains less bloatware and it's smoothness. Here the Realme UI doesn't disappoint me with their user interface. There is some bloatware but you can uninstall most of them and there is an option to reduce the ads. I didn't face much issues with the Realme UI. I like it    7) Battery  I am satisfied with the battery life and charging speed. I don't know about the battery performance in case of gaming. But as a normal user, I am very satisfied with the battery performance.    8) Performance  No lags, No crashes, very smooth performance in case of multitasking. Very good RAM management.

First of all i would like to say realme's UI is great, i was a font of Oxygen os but realme ui 2.0 didn't disappointed me, it have almost all the features + extra which i was using earlier. Performance is awesome, didn't heat up, phone is really handy and screen is really gorgeous. Despite using 120hz refresh rate i was getting Screen On time of about approximately 7 hrs, and charging of this thing is damn good. Gets full charge from 20% to 100% in about 40 mints. One of the coolest thing is the feature called Smooth Scrolling which i got from realme Lab. Camera is average but takes pretty good shot in well lit conditions, i will attach photos for your reference. Network reception is really very good, i was able to get good downloading speeds for my Jio and airtel sims in low network symbols also. It comes with Google dialer l, little announcement of call recording is bit annoying, i think realme will address in coming updates. After setting the phone their will be ota update of around 685 mb i recommend all of you to update it before using the phone. In-display fingerprint and face unlock both is lightning fast. Moreover phone comes with UFS 3.1 storage which speed up the app loading times. Phone comes with pre-applied screen protector and a protective case, its edges are little raised which offers good screen protection.

First of all i would like to say realme's UI is great, i was a font of Oxygen os but realme ui 2.0 didn't disappointed me, it have almost all the features + extra which i was using earlier. Performance is awesome, didn't heat up, phone is really handy and screen is really gorgeous. Despite using 120hz refresh rate i was getting Screen On time of about approximately 7 hrs, and charging of this thing is damn good. Gets full charge from 20% to 100% in about 40 mints. One of the coolest thing is the feature called Smooth Scrolling which i got from realme Lab. Camera is average but takes pretty good shot in well lit conditions, i will attach photos for your reference. Network reception is really very good, i was able to get good downloading speeds for my Jio and airtel sims in low network symbols also. It comes with Google dialer l, little announcement of call recording is bit annoying, i think realme will address in coming updates. After setting the phone their will be ota update of around 685 mb i recommend all of you to update it before using the phone. In-display fingerprint and face unlock both is lightning fast. Moreover phone comes with UFS 3.1 storage which speed up the app loading times. Phone comes with pre-applied screen protector and a protective case, its edges are little raised which offers good screen protection.

5987,"MOTOROLA Edge 20 Fusion (Electric Graphite, 128 GB)",Ju********,5,"Highly recommended, finally found what I was looking for !","For a stock android feel, this phone ticks almost all boxes for ""regular"" usage.    1) Near stock android experience is a the best feature. My primary reason to buy this phone. Have tried other UIs but this is better hands on.  2) Battery Life is simply crazy. Understand it's a new phone but 100% charge is lasting 3 days on average normal usage which was unexpected. Also charging is quite good with 30W charger and takes around 120 mins for 0 to full.  3) Amoled Screen is a big improvement from Moto over recent offerings. The screen quality is awesome. Honestly 60 Hz itself feels great, 90 Hz option is a plus.  4) Headphone jack is very important to me and its retention is another reason for buying this.  5) Side mounted Fingerprint scanner is extremely fast and responsive. Double tap feature is handy as well.  6) Ready for software app is also great addition by default, highly appreciate it. Other Moto apps are also mostly useful and not annoying like some other UI apps.  7) The look and feel although not fancy, it is still elegant and quite comfortable to hold and use and for the size it doesn't not feel heavy.  8) 5G support with 13 bands makes it future proof which is a plus as I hope to use this phone for a long time.  9) I haven't faced any issue with Wifi. It's working fine with normal speeds I get on other devices like laptop. Nothing extraordinary nor disappointing.  10) My expectations from camera were pretty low based on multiple reviews and feedback but surprisingly I didn't find any issues there as well. The primary lens is more than decent to get great pictures. Ultrawide is ok. I heaved a big sigh of relief. Really do not care about selfie or the third useless lens.  11) They have provided a hybrid slot but if they had provided a triple slot I'd have loved it.  12) Lastly the dedicated Google assistant key should have been re-mappable which would have just nailed it.  13) No idea about gaming as I'm not into it    At this price point, with primarily a clean software experience, this is a practical, no nonsensical, great value for money product. With OnePlus getting Colorized and Google Pixel not caring enough for Indian market, this is one of the rare option for stock android like experience. IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE !  My bet is you won't regret it.",27 days ago,22,110

Screen is super duper awesome and also very big in size. Back camera is good but not better nor best. The issue is front camera. In front camera while to take selfie it look like you have some sort of skin disease or something in video call too it doesnt seems clear and our face come out as if having some skin disease. May be it is some software issue or maybe its camera is super clear. Don't know. I am not satisfied with the quality of front camera. I couldn't replace as my brother was in hurry to buy any phone and he left with phone as soon as we received the phone. If you want selfie camera then don't buy this one. Else you will end up break up with your loved ones.😂 also the packing of the phone by the seller was worse no safe casing. Phone box was hitting up down inside the box.,29 days ago,70,210

I have been a fan of Motorola mobiles (because of stock Android) but this particular phone is a bit of a disappointment, given it's price. I bought the 8 GB variant in cyber teal color.    -The finger print sensor is not fast enough in unlocking the mobile. I don't know if the unit I got is faulty or not but my finger print sensor is NOT able to Lock the phone, though it is able to Unlock it. I tried using other fingers as well but I am not able to lock my mobile using the finger print scanner.    - Below average cameras. Grainy images. Not able to focus properly. If you like taking a lot of pics using your mobile then skip buying this phone.    - Huge learning curve when it comes to operating this device. No Back or Home button. Just navigation bar.  Took me 2-3 days to get a hang of it.    - Average speakers. Expected more for this price point.    - Average looks. Dull color. Back panel attracts lots of finger prints. Better looking mobiles available at this price.    - The only Good qualities in this mobile is stock Android, 5G, Good battery life and decent display.

Battery easily coming up for 1and half days with total of 8-9 hrs approx and is very satisfied with weight of 185gm  2. Low light main camera can be still better.  3. Selfie camera didn't expect this worse even though it claims 32MP taken photos are not clean with hardly any filtering done on after taken images.  4. Performance is very smooth as stock Android is there.  5. Overall storage management more than 100GB which is sufficient enough but cannot use 2 sim if SD card is used.  6. Overall for the budget less than 20k which we got in offer it's NOT worth over other samsung. But if you don't want to compromise on camera then don't go for this....  7.

I will Give some my point of view about this phone after using for 15 days  1. Display - a very Beautifully designed aspect ratio for display the Amold display with 2400*1080 resolution is very good display performance fantabulous.  2. Camera - The rear camera is 108 MP which is not useful rather i would say it should have 64 MP is sufficient 108Mp is fake is not required, Motorola shouldn't have to compete with other brands for increasing the camera lenses and megapixel Motorola is the brand in its it has some standard so please do maintain do not need to Compete with others. Micro camera is also not working properly some images are very good for clicking in day light bt very bad in Low light. Very noisy image appears it can be sorted by software update its depends upon moto. the front Camera is not worthy 32mp its very bad at Focusing Beside object. Eg if u r taking Selfie with ur frend then u r Img will apear cool bt ur friends img will get blur .. so it happens with high megapixel to focus from centre bt i personally suggest Give Less megapixel bt please provide quality.. like an apple.  3. Battery - Its 5000Mh its fabulous if u r using for regular work it will long last for a day .. and the backup and charging is really good .30W charger is the best selection for the phone.  Overall the default in this phone is only camera .. if Motorola resolve this isse It would be the one of the best phone of the year....",21 days ago,6,18

(4×1.6 GHz +4×1.2 GHz) compared to realme c2.  6)The processor's architecture is 28 nano meter (nm)  thus, there is heating issue(i feel) and battery  consumption issue compared to realme c2 which  has 12 nm architecture .😫  {less nm = more performance}  7)the company doesn't provide a back cover .  8)speaker quality is average.  9)the itel OS is seems to be similar to cheetah OS  which is in infinix mobiles.  10)we don't know about the glass quality .  (whether it is gorilla glass or not)  11)the touch screen is not so responsive (as i feel)  (cheetah OS is not very secure as I heard OK )  12){optional} I don't think itel will provide any future  updates ( such as android 10 and security patch )  because the company did not claimed about it.  therefore it is a great drawback.🤐    NOW,  lets proceed to the pros : 😋  1)the front camera clicks decent photos.  2)the design is really awesome.😍  3)the process spreadtrum sc9863a has arm cortex  A55 comparatively better than arm cortex A53  (in realme c2)its 20% faster more faster than A53.  4) I did not get any ad on it.(there is no ad may be)  5)ram management is good and good for multi  tasking as it has 3gb ram.  6)It supports split screen ,i did listen music in youtube  and internet surfing simultaneously. its really good  i did not feel any lack on it.😊  7)It has default video calling option which is fantastic.  8)though the frequency is less , the app opening time  is pretty good. I did not feel any lagging.  9)the rear camera has professional photography  mode option . which is fantastic😌  10)battery backup is quite decent.  11)the mobile is quite handy . that feels good.  12)the screen brightness in outdoor is good enough.  as i was playing free fire in Sunshine , i didn't feel  much problem of visibility.  13)and finally don't forget one thing, it has FINGER  PRINT SENSOR which is very fast and which is  missing in realme c2( thats a huge draw back  of realme c2).    PERSONALLY I AM A REALME 6 USER ! AND THIS MOBILE HAS QUITE IMPRESSED ME . ITS NOT TOO BAD I FEELS BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE OF USAGE.  i thought of buying realme c2 . but the problem is that realme c2 does not have finger print sensor . and i really hate about it . therefore i choose to buy this mobile . i checked the battery charging test of realme c2 on youtube and i got no difference . it took same time to recharge the battery. and the performance statistics is also comparatively as good as realme c2.  also one thing , i was getting realme c2 of ram 2gb and itel vision 1 with 3 gb ram at same price. therefore why to choose 2 gb ram😂 instead i finally decided to buy this .  you see, i am a realme 6 user and if i have liked this mobile and if this is quite impressive to me , then definitely you will also like this mobile . i guarantee you.  THEREFORE, BUY IT MY FRIEND 😉☺️    i have wasted 1 hour to write this review . if you find it helpful , then please give a 👍.  🙏🙏🙏JAI HIND🙏🙏🙏","Aug, 2020",1389,5556

Initial experience -  I was pleasantly surprised with the quick delivery of the phone.  On opening the package, I was even more surprised pleasantly, as not only the phone but it's battery and charger are also made in India.  The phone has a removable battery.  The phone has a nice blue colour.  The phone is easy to set up. Performance of the phone is decent as it did not lag (normal usage with social media etc.). Full charging takes slightly over 2 hours and then it easily lasts for 2 days with normal usage. A screen guard was also given along with the phone.    To summarise the positives and not so positives of the phone -  Positives - Made in India; Good performance; Huge battery; 2 sim slots + 1 data card slot; Value for money.  Negatives - None found till now.",24 days ago,104,520

6141,"SAMSUNG Galaxy M12 (White, 128 GB)",Fl***************,1,Utterly Disappointed,I am writing this review after using this phone for 2 months. This is my 4th smart phone from Samsung. From my experience I would say this phone is one of the worst product ever from Samsung. Never go for this product. 2010's 2 magapixal nokia phone cameras were far far better than this phone camera. Also the phone is very slow. Very less features are being integrated with this phone. The battery hardly last upto 12-18 hours for normal internet surfing and calls. I urge samsung should stop such product. Definitely this will spoil the Samsung reputation. I personally never go for any Samsung product. Also never recommend any one to buy any product from Samsung.,4 months ago,514,514
6142,"SAMSUNG Galaxy M12 (White, 128 GB)",su**************,1,Very poor,"Totally dissapointed .. I was using one plus 5 and after so much recommendations from my friends, I finally decided to go for Samsung after 10-15 years or so, but earlier decisions were better.. totally unhappy with the touch ,sometimes it's ultra sensitive and sometimes it's totally unresponsive.    No fast charging . Whatever Samsung claims but it takes life time for complete charging.    No use of Samsung apps and app store..such a waste of memory ..    Weight of the mobile is too much .. if you are on long phone calls than u have no other option rather than using headphone ..    Overall totally disappointed.. next time will be going for one plus or any other but not Samsung ..    After using it for 1 month , some things r definitely not worth like the weight, it's enormous ..u can't put it on mobile holder in car,as no mobile holder is strong enough, it continuously fells off the same .. fast charging is a myth . Today it took 90 min to charge the cell from 15% to 73%..that too when in switched of condition ,otherwise it takes ages to charge fully ... so it was my worst decision to switch to Samsung from one plus ..",2 months ago,8,8

There is a glow/ reflection in the light that makes it stand out.  Camera is above average and the shots taken capture good detail . Night / low light shots are strictly average. Battery is excellent.  Box includes a soft case.  Side finger print sensor unlocks fast if used correctly else it is hit or miss. For fast unlocks you will have to ideally use the right hand thumb.  Audio is good but A53 was better as this doesn't have dual stereo speakers.  This doesn't support 5G - for that buy A53S    Looks : Excellent  Battery Life: Excellent  Rear camera day: Above average -Good  Rear camera night: Average  Selfie cam: Good  Processor / speed: Above Average  For heavy gaming : Below average  Fast charging: Good  OS: Color OS v7.2 - Very good  Audio quality : Good  Fingerprint Sensor: Good  Display: Good,6 months ago,190,760

6173,"vivo X70 Pro (Cosmic Black, 256 GB)",Vi***********,3,Fair,"Camera: Camera does stand out from the rest of smartphones in this range.Not going to elaborate on this point much as indeed is it good and everyone has already explained a lot about camera features and reviews.  Display: Display is good,i would not say best because in bright sunlight it does give hard time to use the phone.  Generally you are on medium brigthness and if you go out in sunlight you won't be able to see the display content properly.You have to come under shade then increase the brightness to have the display content visible in bright sunlight.  Battery: I am very disappointed with battery and software optimisation here,reason being battery drains very fast when you are on calls or when screen awake time is higher than average.In the end this is going to annoy you ,i have seen people saying camera is best , can make up for this average or below average battery.You do need a good battery backup eventually in a smartphone.  Charging: Flashcharge is good ,but if you have used oneplus warp charging or realme 65w ,you will find a gap here.Not that fast then comparatively  Speaker: Sound is clear but again a single speaker at the bottom right ,this tends to get covered up when you are using this phone while lying down.  Connectivity : Not faced any issue so far.  Processor:Since it is dimensity 1200,daily or average tasks are done with ease.  But surely it is not the fastest.  Software :Not at all properly optimised comparing with other smartphones (oneplus ,samsung or even xiaomi).  Value for money: It cannot be a value for money if you want an allround smartphone.  If camera is the only priority then it can be a good buy if you managed to grab it around 40k 12 gb version.",29 days ago,10,30

6219,"realme X7 Max (Milky Way, 128 GB)",Na******,4,Pretty good,"I am very satisfied with this device. First of all, I want to tell you that, I am not a hard core gamer and I am using this phone mainly for multitasking like social media usage, watching movies and listening music and my study purposes. So I don't know much about the gaming performance of this device.    1) Build  This phone is very handy. When I am choosing a phone one of my major priority is compactness. In that case I am very satisfied with this device. Build quality is also good, not feel as a cheaper plastic material.    2) Display  This is the gorgeous part of this phone. Every time I unlock the phone and look at it's display my mind will say unknowingly ""wow"". it's one of the best crystal clear display that I am used ever to. Very useful for multimedia purposes. 120Hz refresh rate also help to increase smoothness.    3) Speakers  The sound quality is amazing. The dual speakers doing a great job.    4) Network  The phone impressed me lot in the case of internet speed and call quality. I am struggling with the network speed inside my house for more than a year with my previous device (OnePlus 5). My family members still struggling with the network speed. But after buying this phone I never phase a speed reduction problem or any kind of network issue anywhere inside my house. Superfast network due to carrier aggregation technology.    5) Camera  This is the main drawback of this device. The camera quality is average. You should get better images when using Google cam. But not much difference. Especially the performance of the front camera is not upto the mark. I didn't feel it as a disadvantage because I don't care much about the camera.    6) Realme UI  Previously I am an Oxygen OS user and also a big fan of Oxygen OS. Because it contains less bloatware and it's smoothness. Here the Realme UI doesn't disappoint me with their user interface. There is some bloatware but you can uninstall most of them and there is an option to reduce the ads. I didn't face much issues with the Realme UI. I like it    7) Battery  I am satisfied with the battery life and charging speed. I don't know about the battery performance in case of gaming. But as a normal user, I am very satisfied with the battery performance.    8) Performance  No lags, No crashes, very smooth performance in case of multitasking. Very good RAM management.    Overall it is a great device. Highly recommended",4 months ago,1113,4452

Performance is awesome, didn't heat up, phone is really handy and screen is really gorgeous. Despite using 120hz refresh rate i was getting Screen On time of about approximately 7 hrs, and charging of this thing is damn good. Gets full charge from 20% to 100% in about 40 mints. One of the coolest thing is the feature called Smooth Scrolling which i got from realme Lab. Camera is average but takes pretty good shot in well lit conditions, i will attach photos for your reference. Network reception is really very good, i was able to get good downloading speeds for my Jio and airtel sims in low network symbols also. It comes with Google dialer l, little announcement of call recording is bit annoying, i think realme will address in coming updates. After setting the phone their will be ota update of around 685 mb i recommend all of you to update it before using the phone. In-display fingerprint and face unlock both is lightning fast. Moreover phone comes with UFS 3.1 storage which speed up the app loading times.

Camera is ok both front and back. Battery is 5000mah but draining quite faster so it feels like 4000 mah. But it's has 33w fast charger so it will take around 1hour to full.

6374,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Blue, 256 GB)",Va************,5,Excellent Phone! Read My Review.,"If you're in the market for a compact phone with probably the best cameras in a phone today, that does not sacrifice on performance or any of the flagship features then your decision must start and end with an iPhone. First of all Apple has created something that is a throwback to the best smartphones ever designed - the iphone 5 and 5S. While doing so Apple made sure that it did not compromise on power or performance. The 12 mini has all the features (ALL OF THEM!) of the bigger iPhone 12 - so basically its the same A14 processor, same cameras, same RAM, same OLED screen, same FaceID, same wireless charging, same water resistance, same 5G support and everything else! Except that this is a smaller sized phone physically, which is so comfortable to hold that you'll wonder what happened to the smartphone industry getting obsessed over making bigger devices every year.    Fun fact : Literally 8 years ago in 2013 was when the iPhone 5S was announced. That was considered the gold standard in smartphone design. In 8 years we're carrying phones that are getting so uncomfortably big we have forgotten to use them with one hand. You know what's really funny? Human hands have stayed the same size in the last 8 years too. :D    You're not reading this for fun facts. You're really reading this review wondering if the battery life suffers because of the smaller battery on the mini compared to the regular sized iPhone 12. The simple answer - NOT REALLY!. Let me explain. Compared to the regular sized iPhone 12 - you will get ~1.5 hours less in terms of 100% - fully dead battery for the same level of usage on both phones. You can verify this via several YouTube channels that have tested this extensively. So basically for ~1.5 to 2 hours less battery life you get a phone that is so compact, without sacrificing anything else in terms of features. For me personally this means that I love my iPhone 12 mini. Convenience over 2 extra hours of battery life anyday for me. Plus I got a 20W fast charger that charges my mini from 10% - 100% in about ~45 minutes. My phone charges on Apple Carplay while I'm driving too. So 2 less hours of battery life is overrated for me. But you may disagree and that's fine.    Final verdict : If ~1.5 to 2 hours of extra battery backup along with a slightly bigger screen means more for you and how you want to use your phone, buy the regular sized iPhone 12. But for 2 hours less battery backup you prefer the convenience of carrying around a smaller, lighter phone that has everything that the regular 12 has, then buy the 12 mini without a doubt! This is a question of your priorities. ALSO if you're wondering if suddenly typing on a smaller screen will become an issue coming from a bigger phone, you could not be more wrong! It took me all of only 3 hours to get used to typing on this screen. Just FYI - I switched to this from a OnePlus 7T so I'm really speaking the truth. :D We tend to underestimate the ability of our brain and fingers on how quickly we can adapt to change. :D",7 months ago,511,2555
6375,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Blue, 256 GB)",Na******************,4,Nice product,"As per my usage I think the battery is adequate as I don’t often use my phone and at the end of the as per my usage the battery percentage remains at 40% but if you are a heavy user then you might feel the drain. The screen is small and typing might be an issue but after few minutes on you’ll get used to it, the camera and the screen are awesome and the picture quality superb as per my liking. I would recommend a screen protector as minor scratches may occur, which might be caused while cleaning the dust off the phone etc. The price you are paying for a relatively small phone might give you a thought but it’s worth every penny. Light and durable phone and the shape reminds of the older IPhones the 5 & 5s for me which was the best designed iPhone ever regardless of the size",10 months ago,691,2764

6422,"SAMSUNG Galaxy A21s (Blue, 64 GB)",So**********,4,Pretty good,Very good smartphone. I purchased 6/64 Gb version. I am satisfied with overall phone however without reason my phone restarted 2 times and on 2nd time it was freezed with Samsung on screen. As I am tech savy I pressed volume key up+ down + Power button to complete shut down. It turned off and I rebooted and it works fine. I request that Samsung should release phone update with the fix.    -Display is very good. People are stupid to compare it with SuperAmoloid.. They should know that Super Amoloid doesnot show real colour. It show -over exaggerated color. This phone has PLS display but color is awesome.  -No issues while working on any apps.  -Battery is perfect. I watch video and use it a lot however I got more than 36 hours of backup. It has 15% battery so I put it into charger.  -Little bulky  -Appearance is good and feels adorable while holding on hands.  -Network is awesome. I had Aluminium body phone it has network issue but this one is very good. It works good with WiFi and on 4G also.    Overall the phone is Awesome.

And the display is absolutely the worst. It is not at all a powerful phone. It cannot record Instagram videos without lagging. Camera isnt that great on low light. Note that there is no timelapse. No slow motion. Nothing basically. The only good thing about this phone is the battery. But also, considering the price range, I think we can get better android phones with the basic latest features at least, or even one with a better display. And especially if you have used an iphone before and you want to try a cheap samsung phone, this is a big no no. It's been a real disappointment. Did not expect this from Samsung.","Oct, 2020",40,40

Battery-now a days what ever brand is the main feature is battery life , for this mid range mobile A21S giving awesome powerback experience the people who need good camera , performance and battery life this mobile is good. Because third party company's tested this mobile to give awesome battery experience .and Rated (minimum) capacity is 4,900 mAh. Actual battery life may vary depending on network environment, usage patterns and other factors.  Coming to performance side give a little bit disappointment for gamers , for normal use (less graphical games) performance is excellent, for pubg this range mobile is excellent but using long time little bit disappointment. Other than all are good. I fully satisfied @battery backup , @camera and @performance.

Pros:  1. Camera and image processing (portrait modes)  2. Battery (7hrs screen on time) i.e. all day battery life  3. iOS (If you are coming from Android, you will need 2 days to get used to it.. like gestures and all but once you are into it, there's no way turning back. Animations are refined and you will enjoy them)  4. Face ID is super fast and 100% secure  5. Performance is superior to most Android smartphone in market as of today in this price bracket. A12 it is !!  6. Speakers are excellent  7. Haptic feedback is next level. I can't explain in words.. in short it feels like someone is sitting inside and knocking phone's display 😂😂    Cons:  1. Glass back costs half price of phone itself if in case you end up shattering it  2. Phone is heavy.. 194 grams to be precise and when you add screen guard and back cover, it will add up and finally be around 210~230 grams  3. Battery charging is slow. Like what else will you expect from a 5w charger.  4. Front camera res is 7MP and will give you consistent results for 95% of time but for rest.. be prepared for some horrible selfies 😂    See, if you think that you are ok with a camera performance of 4/5, then blindly go with this phone. And if you are one who has camera as #1 priority then you must go for iPhone 11, it has better cameras.    Pro Tip: Don’t judge it’s display and camera based on just on paper specs and numbers. Both are excellent and 99% people won’t have any problem.  One more thing.. if possible go with a 128 gigs variant. iPhones eat lot of space !!","Aug, 2020",445,1780

6535,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Black, 256 GB)",Va************,5,Excellent Phone! Read My Review.,"If you're in the market for a compact phone with probably the best cameras in a phone today, that does not sacrifice on performance or any of the flagship features then your decision must start and end with an iPhone. First of all Apple has created something that is a throwback to the best smartphones ever designed - the iphone 5 and 5S. While doing so Apple made sure that it did not compromise on power or performance. The 12 mini has all the features (ALL OF THEM!) of the bigger iPhone 12 - so basically its the same A14 processor, same cameras, same RAM, same OLED screen, same FaceID, same wireless charging, same water resistance, same 5G support and everything else! Except that this is a smaller sized phone physically, which is so comfortable to hold that you'll wonder what happened to the smartphone industry getting obsessed over making bigger devices every year.    Fun fact : Literally 8 years ago in 2013 was when the iPhone 5S was announced. That was considered the gold standard in smartphone design. In 8 years we're carrying phones that are getting so uncomfortably big we have forgotten to use them with one hand. You know what's really funny? Human hands have stayed the same size in the last 8 years too. :D    You're not reading this for fun facts. You're really reading this review wondering if the battery life suffers because of the smaller battery on the mini compared to the regular sized iPhone 12. The simple answer - NOT REALLY!. Let me explain. Compared to the regular sized iPhone 12 - you will get ~1.5 hours less in terms of 100% - fully dead battery for the same level of usage on both phones. You can verify this via several YouTube channels that have tested this extensively. So basically for ~1.5 to 2 hours less battery life you get a phone that is so compact, without sacrificing anything else in terms of features. For me personally this means that I love my iPhone 12 mini. Convenience over 2 extra hours of battery life anyday for me. Plus I got a 20W fast charger that charges my mini from 10% - 100% in about ~45 minutes. My phone charges on Apple Carplay while I'm driving too. So 2 less hours of battery life is overrated for me. But you may disagree and that's fine.    Final verdict : If ~1.5 to 2 hours of extra battery backup along with a slightly bigger screen means more for you and how you want to use your phone, buy the regular sized iPhone 12. But for 2 hours less battery backup you prefer the convenience of carrying around a smaller, lighter phone that has everything that the regular 12 has, then buy the 12 mini without a doubt! This is a question of your priorities. ALSO if you're wondering if suddenly typing on a smaller screen will become an issue coming from a bigger phone, you could not be more wrong! It took me all of only 3 hours to get used to typing on this screen. Just FYI - I switched to this from a OnePlus 7T so I'm really speaking the truth. :D We tend to underestimate the ability of our brain and fingers on how quickly we can adapt to change. :D",7 months ago,511,2555
6536,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Black, 256 GB)",Na******************,4,Nice product,"As per my usage I think the battery is adequate as I don’t often use my phone and at the end of the as per my usage the battery percentage remains at 40% but if you are a heavy user then you might feel the drain. The screen is small and typing might be an issue but after few minutes on you’ll get used to it, the camera and the screen are awesome and the picture quality superb as per my liking. I would recommend a screen protector as minor scratches may occur, which might be caused while cleaning the dust off the phone etc. The price you are paying for a relatively small phone might give you a thought but it’s worth every penny. Light and durable phone and the shape reminds of the older IPhones the 5 & 5s for me which was the best designed iPhone ever regardless of the size",10 months ago,691,2764

Battery : 4000 mah on paper. But after good usage for whole day, still left with 50% battery. I didn't test with gaming as I am not a gamer.    Performance : Decent enough to do multiple tasking and fast enough without any lags. 7 series SD chipset with 8GB Ram does the job easily. But not for pubg. Or any heavy games.    Display : Amoled display is smooth and even in full bright sun you can clearly see the display with ease. Don't compare with M51 display. Good enough for multimedia    Looks : Insane look as I took Sunset melody variant.    Overall Verdict : If you are not a gamer.

Display: Display is good,i would not say best because in bright sunlight it does give hard time to use the phone.  Generally you are on medium brigthness and if you go out in sunlight you won't be able to see the display content properly.You have to come under shade then increase the brightness to have the display content visible in bright sunlight.  Battery: I am very disappointed with battery and software optimisation here,reason being battery drains very fast when you are on calls or when screen awake time is higher than average.In the end this is going to annoy you ,i have seen people saying camera is best , can make up for this average or below average battery.You do need a good battery backup eventually in a smartphone.  Charging: Flashcharge is good ,but if you have used oneplus warp charging or realme 65w ,you will find a gap here.Not that fast then comparatively  Speaker: Sound is clear but again a single speaker at the bottom right ,this tends to get covered up when you are using this phone while lying down.  Connectivity : Not faced any issue so far.  Processor:Since it is dimensity 1200,daily or average tasks are done with ease.  But surely it is not the fastest.  Software :Not at all properly optimised comparing with other smartphones (oneplus ,samsung or even xiaomi).  Value for money: It cannot be a value for money if you want an allround smartphone.

Since you all know this is all about camera smartphone. The camera is simply awesome and actually does the job as claimed by the brand. Few attached images for reference. Still if you have any doubt, I would suggest you to visit your nearby stores to check yourself.  Now apart from camera the processor is not very powerful but it is very stable and can handle almost everything.  This is NOT a GAMING SMARTPHONE. However, I have played cod and asphalt 8&9 on max settings and it runs very smoothly. I do play games but am not a hardcore gamer.  The OS is good and is highly customisable.  The charger is fast and does the job perfectly.  And lastly, one will get amazed with the design of the smartphone, it really feels premium.    I can surely recommend this smartphone to the people who are NOT hardcore gamers and want a premium smartphone which will do all the daily tasks very fast and smoothly with a good battery life and an exceptional camera.

6614,"vivo X70 Pro (Aurora Dawn, 256 GB)",kr*****,5,Fabulous!,"I am a V20 user for a year.  Comes to the x70 pro, Fairly good job done by the vivo in the camera and display department especially but I feel it's not upto the mark and hype that vivo advertised.    What I really observed in the first impression is ,the photos comes out is not atleast the level of V20 in stable shots,why I mentioned that v20 was not OIS one,but pics are pleasent and usable.    X70 pro pics are over saturated and some color quantization is there and not useful after from the mobile.  Here the display was good,so u get some good quality when viewing from that but when input those to big displays ,u will see the difference clearly and V20 wins here.  Pictures are oversaturated,not natural ones.  This time I am disappointed with vivo.    Battery is quite decent enough and is truly depends on ur usage stats.  Processing power was not upto the mark.    Basically I am just a user to go out for photography mostly for my best ones and the samples attached here straight out from the camera.U may have idea what exactly this phone do.  I am doing browsing,banking and photography with this .  Not recommended when comes to the photography needs,best to buy V series or others and u won't disappoint either.    Selfie camera was too worst.    Pros:  Display  Battery  Photography options  Form factor        Cons:  Processor  cameras or software      This review was described as per my knowledge,may others can see better.

6713,"Redmi K20 (Pearl White, 128 GB)",Ni**********,5,Terrific purchase,"*EDIT* when I don't play PUBG, I get more than 9 hrs of screen on time, watch attached screenshot for proof!    reviewing after 1.5 week of intense (heavy) usage, 6GB RAM 128GB ROM    1) Display - what lacked for so long in Xiaomi devices was AMOLED panels, and this panel on K20 is on par, not close enough to Samsung sAMOLED+ but good enough in bright sunlight, battery efficient with dark mode! u get ambient display, dark mode, and whenever u pick up the phone fingerprint imprint is shown at the sensor ..... 8/10    2) Performance - works like charm, no issues at all! PUBG is flawless, HDR option is yet to come, 38°C is the highest temperature reached after 1 hour of PUBG (ambient temperature 28) ...... 10/10    3) Cellular Connectivity - where I was getting 1/4 tower in my LeEco Le 2, with this K20 I'm getting 3/5 tower with 4G+ on Airtel with VoLTE, 2nd sim is Jio again with 4G+ with VoLTE ...... 10/10    4) Camera - I don't take much selfie so the front camera is sufficient, but rear camera disappointed me in some ways, as usual struggles in low light conditions. sharpness is not present, clarity is not enough, noise everywhere. during good lighting conditions it does great job, no complaints there! ..... 8/10    5) Design - believe me guys, this one is a very very heavy phone! glass front & back, 4000 mah battery crunched in a small near bezel-less body, even bezels at bottom are narrow, I pick it up upside down many a times. at present there is no smartphone as appealing as K20 series, mic-drop! .... 10/10    6) Battery - I had LeEco Le2, charge for 2 hour for 3 hour usage, I used to charge that smartphone at least 4 times a day! now believe me when I say this, I get at least 7hr 45min of screen on time with 22-26 hr of usage!! it includes 1hr PUBG, 40min YouTube, 2.5 hrs texts, 30 min Calls, with Location ON - high accuracy, Google photos with backup on mobile data, Airtel and Jio both on 4G+ VoLTE. I don't know what they have done with all these AI, battery, or I don't know!! but nowadays I must say smartphone battery lasts!! finally!! 10% to 100% takes 1hr 45min ..... 10/10    CONS  1) In display fingerprint sensor is comparatively slow but does the job, after applying 6D tempered glass is further slows down the process  2) No IR blaster in this Redmi phone  THAT'S IT    at this price point, you get SD730, 13mp ultra wide, 8mp telephoto, 48mp main, 20 mp pop-up selfie camera, 4000mah, 6GB/128GB, AMOLED bezel-less screen, 3.5mm jack, 18w type-c quick charger, gorgeous flame icy design and what not?!!!","Jul, 2019",394,1970
6714,"Redmi K20 (Pearl White, 128 GB)",Su*******************,4,Nice product,"I got delivered my K20 on 22nd Feb'20. Since then I checked the phone all the way. My conclusion is it is a beautiful & powerful phone. Mentioning pros & cons one by one below after 20 days of use.    Pros:    1) Processor:  Snapdragon 730 processor is super duper fast. It processes tasks in fraction of second. Though I am not a pubg gamer but I can understand that to run pubg, 730 Snapdragon is not even required.    2) Display:  Be informed it is NOT 'Super' Amoled. It has only amoled display with 1080p full hd screen. Which gives you approx 98% similarity with Samsung Super Amoled display. Display of K20 is unimaginable.    3) Camera:  Rear cam standard mode is 13mp, telephoto is 5mp & wide angle is 8mp, which gives actual pleasure to click some outstanding pictures. It has 48mp rear cam option if you want a bigger size pic. Portrait mode (bokeh) gives you almost DSLR quality background blur. You can even control the background blur after clicking the photo. Telephoto gives you upto 10x digital zoom & wide angle gives you .6x digital zoom. It has 20mp super power pop up selfie camera. Which lights up & sounds up while popping up & dwn & these light and sound makes this phone exceptionally outstanding. You can also use bokeh (potrait) mode on selfie camera. I have uploaded few bokeh mode, wide mode, standard mode & selfie photos. You can check them.    4) Battery:  4000mAh battery gives me about 18/19hrs of working life. If I unplug the 18watt fast charger at 2am of the night after 100% charge, it shows 99% at 10am of the next morning without use. Damdar battery.    Cons:    1) In-screen fingerprint display:  This one is annoying me a little. The in-screen fingerprint is not as fast as Oppo, Vivo or Realme flagship phones. It takes about 1/3 second to unlock the phone. Also don't expect any in-screen fingerprint as fast as back side fingerprint. Again K20 is way more faster than Mi A30 & little slower than Realme X2. Trust me, you will be habituated with it.    2) Android 10:  The K20 comes with Android 9 (Pie) version. But within 24hrs you’ll be notified about android 10 system update. I am using the v10 but won't recommend you to update to Android 10. It is not bug free. Google need to rectify this version of Android. Stick to your Android 9 only. But MiUi 11 is really fun. Update that asap.    Now what else. Aaj ke liye itna hi. I hope that I made a firat hand & unbiased review on this phone.    My overall rating is 4 out of 5.

Like other MI phones slight heating is observed during charging near cameras. Xiomi should improve on this aspect of heating while charging. But that's not deal breaker issue though.

Prospective buyers can then decide    1. For photo and video enthusiasts. Very reliable camera. Fast and excellent picture quality. Videos are absolutely stable and professional quality. You would be amazed how many people shoot Youtube videos on an iPhone. The only downside is that the display doesn’t do justice to the photos and videos you have taken. Night photos are also not that great but if you get Neural cam app for 400 bucks its well worth it.    2. Very reliable performance. No lag whatsoever. All major apps work better than android counterparts. Internet connection is also more stable. It functions exactly how a smartphone should be.    3. Its fun when you have more apple devices. I have an iPad and airdrop is an amazing feature    4. For those who don’t want to lug a heavy oversized phone in your pocket and but needs all that high end power in a compact form, this phone is the perfect choice.    5. For those who don’t play heavy games and media consumption is moderate. Isn’t that how life supposed to be? More living and less glued to your phone? This is one of the main reasons I switched to this phone. Reduce your big screen and media consumption addiction.    6. If you are okay with charging every night after a day of moderate usage.

Pros:  1. Camera and image processing (portrait modes)  2. Battery (7hrs screen on time) i.e. all day battery life  3. iOS (If you are coming from Android, you will need 2 days to get used to it.. like gestures and all but once you are into it, there's no way turning back. Animations are refined and you will enjoy them)  4. Face ID is super fast and 100% secure  5. Performance is superior to most Android smartphone in market as of today in this price bracket. A12 it is !!  6. Speakers are excellent  7. Haptic feedback is next level. I can't explain in words.. in short it feels like someone is sitting inside and knocking phone's display 😂😂    Cons:  1. Glass back costs half price of phone itself if in case you end up shattering it  2. Phone is heavy.. 194 grams to be precise and when you add screen guard and back cover, it will add up and finally be around 210~230 grams  3. Battery charging is slow. Like what else will you expect from a 5w charger.  4. Front camera res is 7MP and will give you consistent results for 95% of time but for rest.. be prepared for some horrible selfies 😂    See, if you think that you are ok with a camera performance of 4/5, then blindly go with this phone. And if you are one who has camera as #1 priority then you must go for iPhone 11, it has better cameras.    Pro Tip: Don’t judge it’s display and camera based on just on paper specs and numbers. Both are excellent and 99% people won’t have any problem.  One more thing.. if possible go with a 128 gigs variant. iPhones eat lot of space !!","Aug, 2020",445,1780

Writing this review after a week    Pros:  * Supports portable Hotspot for both bands bands 2.5 ghz and 5ghz  * Good battery life lasts for 1.5 days for normal usage(like WhatsApp, instagram)  * Brought the blue color variant, it's stunning when compared to the black color variant  * Has support for dual 4g volte  * Color os 6 one of the easy to use smart UI  * Back camera has 5x zoom, could take some good macroshot depending upon the lighting  * Cellular reception is also good    Cons:  * It's still running on color os 6.x based on android 9 pie out of the box. I don't why, some device at this price or below are offering android 10. While the time of writing this review android 11 betas are also out and still oppo is strucked with Android 9. I will write a review later if any updates come  * Front Camera is below average for indoor lighting conditions.

6915,"SAMSUNG Galaxy F62 (Laser Grey, 128 GB)",Ra*****,4,Really Nice,"Honest Review :  Its been almost 2 months I am using this mobile. So, now I can come to its :  PROS:  1) The display quality is out of this world(Excellent) !  2) The UI is great.  3) Battery Backup is good.  4) Samsung Knox security is on point !    5) Now, coming to gaming - Believe me you will get a good experience !! Pubg runs super smooth .    And there is a little over-heating at times for which you will experience some lag, tough it is common for any smart phone.  6) Fingerprint sensor runs smoothly.    Now coming to CONS:  1)The phone does heat a bit at the top while setting up the device.  2) The quality of back material ( ** Poly Carbonate Body or you can also say Glastic Back ** ) is not that good for the price.  3) I have noticed a little bit of lag at times .Though majority of time it runs smoothly . Hope it can be fixed through updates.  4) Samsung should have provided a 30W charger. It takes roughly 2 hrs of time to charge itself .  5) No Back Case.  6) Camera quality is not justified . Seriously, its a down grade from Samsung.  7) No 4G+ support.  8) ""Sometimes"" it doesn't connect to wifi.  9) This is a bulky phone !! Feels like I am holding a brick.

6918,"SAMSUNG Galaxy F62 (Laser Grey, 128 GB)",An********,5,Highly recommended,"The battery and performance of the phone is excellent. Camera is also good, though there could be more improvements for the price paid. I have tried Night Mode, Digital Zooming and Landscapes, they work great. The diaplay of Super Amoled Plus is very immersive and the Android 11 UI 3.1 is very user friendly. Also if you have Samsung, try using Quick Share option, they are very fast in transferring images from one samsung to another. It takes a while to charge the 7k mAh phone, and heats up which assures that heat sink inside the phone is working properly. This phone also has an inbuilt Screen Recorder, which was not there in my prev Samsung. Overall, the product is nice, you can consider buying it.",7 months ago,1545,7725

6922,"SAMSUNG Galaxy F62 (Laser Grey, 128 GB)",Sw************,5,Just wow!,"Finally an amazing product by Samsung which offers great performance. Well we all are pretty much familiar with the pros(as most of us has researched this product on YouTube) now let's discuss the cons:    1. No carrier aggregation, even if the hardware is capable of it (if you don't know what is it just perform a Google search).    2. The Back panel is prone to fingerprints and scratches. Get a case ASAP.    3. The Night mode of both the cameras(front and rear) should have been better but it can be fixed via software updates.    4. Limited support of Good lock modules.    5. As it is an Exynos processor, the full support of CAMERA 2 API is not there and hence Gcam cannot be used to it's utmost potential.    6. The bottom firing single speaker is not that good considering the price.    7. And now something related to the ads, if you don't set up your device carefully on the first boot then there would be ads, there are pre-installed blotware , but they can be removed easily. One thing I noticed is when you open the weather application you'll find a Snap Chat ad on the top of the weather stats.    One thing I want to mention is that see it doesn't support 5G, if you think that this is not going to be future proof and stuff then I think you should reconsider your thought as the rollout of 5G in India is still a distant dream (though the service providers are trying to bring it ASAP) but it'll take time , indeed a very long time and it'll be very costly. And most other brands are launching 5g phones , but they mostly consist of only one or two bands and if those bands are not supported in India then it's a complete waste of your hard earned money.",8 months ago,1405,7025

6925,"Redmi Note 7 Pro (Space Black, 64 GB)",Pr*******,4,Good choice,"Hi Guys,  I am writing this review though I know thousands of us has already reviewed this phone and it's already a superstar in the category.  so only sharing My views and experience with the phone. I am actively using the phone since last 16 days and here is the experience. so lets start:  1. Main USP of phone is it's Camera and yes MI note 7 pro is really a PRO in this area. see the pics attached if you notice there are two pics of Buddha, let me tell you there was no light difference while clicking those pics I just switched the mode to professional mode (in red one) and you can see the difference in both of them. 48 MP shot is also mind blowing. it takes some 3-4 second time to set and adjust but believe me it worth the pic you will take. JUST AMAZING!    2. Gaming in this phone is like butter.. PUBG runs buttery smooth. Gaming Boost feature is just superb, it uses Ram efficiently and Snapdragon 675 processer chipset does the rest. and yes it got heated after approx 30 min of play but again I think it's normal to every phone.    3. Display is very crisp and auto bright feature works well. On full brightness phone display is fully visible and you can use the phone under sun easily.    4. RAM management is very nice and phone doesn't lag while doing multi tasking. however I feel some minor lags while switching to other app, but again it was avoidable so all good here too.    5. BATTERY: Here comes the weak point (not that much) of this phone, though it has 4000mah battery yet it didn't perform like 4000. with 4-5 hours of on screen time , 45 mins of approx gaming (mostly PUBG) and 8-10 calls it lasts for 10 hours only , which disappointed me. I was expect at least 20-24 hours of back up.    6. CHARGING : One more weak point is it's charger, MI has saved the money and reduced the cost of phone by providing simple charger (2A only), you have to purchase a fast charger from market which will easily cost you around 1k. BAD:(    7. LOOKS: Yes look-wise it's awesome. drop notch is nice and it doesn't irritate you much, you can adjust the screen (on/off screen buttons) in its settings. Back side is given with glass finish and it really looks premium in your hands. only problem is it's camera bump. It's irritating and you have to use a proper back panel to protect it otherwise it might have scratchs easily. which destroys the overall look of the phone:(    Verdict: Final verdict is overall it's a flagship phone in its category and a mid segment user can choose this phone for their hard earned money, you won't regret :) :)  THANKS AND SORRY FOR THE LONG REVIEW. IF IT HELPS YOU THEN PLZ HIT LIKE BUTTON, IT WILL SURELY ENCOURAGE ME TO REVIEW MORE PRODUCTS FOR YOU GUYS.","Jul, 2019",10172,40688
6926,"Redmi Note 7 Pro (Space Black, 64 GB)",Ya********,4,Nice product,Hello everyone  I am using this product for 2weeks and here are the things which I liked and the problems I faced  1. If you are switching from a regular smartphone to the bezel less phone you might love this phone since it's having 6.3 inches IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen.  2. Ads on MIUI are a bit irritating but it can be turned off when booting the phone for the first time.  The ads however stays in some applications mainly those which are pre-installed and are non-removable.  3. Redmi offers a lot more features like IR blaster and LED notification (very small though) and much more.. which may make your smartphone to be the all-in-one package device.  4. The device gets hot when you use the camera for a bit long but the photos taken are excellent.  Camera app lags when you switch from normal mode - portrait mode or any other and sometimes it might get closed unexpectedly or may not respond quickly.  5. Gaming and web surfing are pretty good and the phone does not get heated while playing PUBG.  6. Sometimes there is an issue of hearing through the earpiece. There's an option of boosting up the volume but again there may be times when you can't hear the other person's voice clearly.  Overall the phone is very good having a great camera and all the specs you need in this price range.,"May, 2019",1709,6836

Snapdragon 675 works swifly enough with 6GB RAM and with 128G one need not worry about space.    Battery performance is sufficient. It will easily stay from a day to 1 1/2 day on normal usage. Did not face any heating issue.    And loved the finger print sensor as well as the face unlock feature. Works in no time.    Finally super quick delivery by Flipkart. Less than 24 hours.    Cons:  Yes, the camera bump behind may get damaged if not taken care. Take a proper back cover.  48mp picture does take few seconds 2-3 secs.

Literally feels pretty smooth (refresh rate of 120 hz has to be set manually). Gaming experience is quite well (COD & 8 ball pool). Camera- outdoor and indoor during day time is very good but it shows a lot of noise on output of nightmode cam, rest of its feature working quite well except that 108mp doesn't really feels that much. Look wise it's too good, but feels heavy even with the provided back cover. You might face a lot of glitches in the UI, but those would be fixed in future updates (keep updating MIUI). It has a slight heating issue, but it's not over heating. Display is outstanding. Overall performance is very good and satisfies the value for money. It doesn't have a notification light, so it has some other cool way of notifying (leaving that to you to find it yourself as surprise). Battery life is quite good as well.

7045,"realme 6 Pro (Lightning Orange, 64 GB)",Ak****,5,Perfect product!,"RM6 PRO LONG TERM REVIEW    Having used the Realme 6 pro for 30 days intensly ,I guess I can help all of you out there to make a well informed decison :) .I'm taking this effort so that you’ll know whether your money is worth investing on this phone.Please read on if you consider buying it.      1) DESIGN : 4.5/5 .  The phone feels premium and I love the flashy design of realme 6 pro.The weight is manageable once you get used to it .The design is subjective and is a matter of personal preference though.      2) DISPLAY : 4/5 .  90 hz display makes the phone so fast for general usage.The display is decently bright as well for day to day activities whether you are inside or outside.But yes,The phone could have been more brighter especially outdoors. You have to pull the brightness all the way up to get a good view of the phone under sunlight.    I'm glad that the phone came with an LCD panel.I always prefer LCD display over AMOLED for its balanced colors , less strain to the eye , no screen burn issues and the low cost for replacement under any accident.      3) PERFORMANCE : 5/5 .  The SD 720G SoC inside is optimised so well to handle 90hz display and day to day tasks.The RAM management is so good as well.You get around 3.5 gb free ram for your activities. With regard to fluidity of the phone, there hasn't been lags or stutters of any kind except a rare hiccup i experienced when playing youtube videos via chrome browser.Its not a deal breaker though.      4) CAMERA : 4.5/5 .  The versatility of cameras at this price point is unbelievable. The 2x optical zoom providing telephoto lens and Ultra wide front camera makes the phone so compelling. The 64 MP main cam and the 12 MP ultra wide has great dynamic range does its job so well. I feel the 16 MP front camera is also good enough but the macro camera is only a gimmick with no much usage.      5) SOFTWARE. 4.5/5.  The realme UI is minimalistic and fluid with all the features you'd wanna have in a modern smart phone. There is a stock like feel when you use the phone with no ads issue at all.I'm hoping for realme to take this forward and come close to the likes of oxygen OS and stock android.      6) BATTERY : 4/5 .  The battery is efficient enough to last you for a day.As a moderate user, I get around 10 hours of screen on time( at 90 hz ref rate) with 20-30 % percentage left by the end of the day. But I wish if the phone had 4500-5000 mAh considering the long run usage of the phone as batteries will deteriorate over time leaving us with lesser capacity.30 watt charger is fast enough to charge the phone from 10 to 100% under an hour.    NOTE THIS :  Having seen a lot of users at realme community complaining about the battery drainage post software updates,I kept the phone in the same software version at the time of purchase without doing any system software updates.    The phone is already performing beyond my expectations at hardware and software level, so i don't see the point of updating the phone unless realme fixes the issue.    CONCLUSION.  If you are looking for an all round futuristic phone to serve you for long run, Realme 6 pro has covered all the areas to ensure this. I'd recommend you to go for this if you want a BALANCE in all the 6 areas that makes a phone worthy. The competitors at this price level (poco x2, note 9 pro max, one fusion + ) has certain edge in 1 or 2 features, but they lack another feature by a relatively big margin making them unbalanced for the price.Now the choice is upto you to make :)    Please consider reacting(like/dislike) to the review so that we can get the truth to more people like us who seek a genuine review.Thankyou for your patience and time guys :) :)","Aug, 2020",1349,6745
7046,"realme 6 Pro (Lightning Orange, 64 GB)",Da******************************************,5,Genuine review after five days usage.,"Undoubtedly this is a masterpiece. I took about a year to decide and am COMPLETELY satisfied. Here are the details:    * Fantastic and perfect cameras. 100% value for your money. PERFECT results. I am over satisfied (I am also a DSLR photographer). The zoom is REALLY good, try it in the daylight. Night mode is much superior as compared to the other handsets. The best part is that it has a front-facing ultra-wide-angle selfie camera too. Trust me, you'll NEVER regret once you buy it. Everything is great.    * Very satisfactory battery life. Lasts very long (thanks to the latest OS based on Android 10). CHARGES VERY-VERY FAST (thanks to 30w charger)    * Display is amazing. Are you looking upon the LCD display like a pauper as compared to the AMOLED? :)) That means you haven't really upgraded your technical knowledge. In fact, LCD (what we get now) displays more realistic and accurate colors than AMOLED. AMOLED punches the colors more than they actually are. Anyhow, I am TOTALLY satisfied with this display and would sincerely recommend going for it.    * Fingerprint scanner and facial unlock are both LIGHTNING FAST.    * Ah, Lightning, the design. I am sure you might feel a bit reluctant after seeing the odd lightning design in the advertisements. But what you see in the ads is not what you actually get. Somehow it is much more pleasing, sober and attractive. How do you think could a company like OPPO (Realme) create anything substandard? Just go for it. You'll like it.    * It is needless to talk about the RAM, ROM, Sensors, Apps, etc, as everything is just perfectly upto the mark.    * The processor is REALLY fast and performs amazingly due to the latest Realme OS.    * The Operating System is too good and also very user friendly. One can modify the system to one's heart's content.    * Everything else is just perfect.    Yes, I know, you also WANT to hear about the cons. So here we go:    * It is a heavy phone. But personally I like it. It feels good when I hold it. A macho phone.    Why should you trust my words? Well, because I am a Hare Krishna monk and have absolutely no desire to cheat anyone anyhow for any selfish motives. I am a common customer and haven't been offered anything for writing this :))    Enjoy your Realme 6 Pro. Hare Krishna.","Mar, 2020",4723,23615

7053,"realme 6 Pro (Lightning Orange, 64 GB)",Sa***********,5,Best in the market!,Best in segment today  Display is good visibility is nice but this phone should have amoled display for better viewing experience because amoled is better far better than 90hz display but 90hz is super smooth 120hz is battery killer but 90 is perfect for this phone.    Camera is best and full of features not as sharp and crisp as poco x2 because of sony sensor.  it has tons of features will upload a camera review on YouTube.  Portrait blur in video mode is awesome front slow motion and wide angle is useful.  You can use night mode in all 4 cameras even in the front camera. Pro mode is also available in all real cameras. Uploaded one front night mode selfie.  Super steady is just perfect you can use both wide angle and main camera for super steady video shots  Thats very stable not as food as the premium phones but its useful in daylight situations like of yi ou are running or if you want very stable pictures.  2x telephoto lens is nice with punchier colors you can record in 2x and 5x hybrid mode      Battery life is just perfect full day of normal use 7 hrs of screesnon time in 90htz and 8+ in 60htz. Charging is so so fast gets fully charged within an hour.,"Mar, 2020",4101,20505

7121,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (White, 256 GB)",Va************,5,Excellent Phone! Read My Review.,"If you're in the market for a compact phone with probably the best cameras in a phone today, that does not sacrifice on performance or any of the flagship features then your decision must start and end with an iPhone. First of all Apple has created something that is a throwback to the best smartphones ever designed - the iphone 5 and 5S. While doing so Apple made sure that it did not compromise on power or performance. The 12 mini has all the features (ALL OF THEM!) of the bigger iPhone 12 - so basically its the same A14 processor, same cameras, same RAM, same OLED screen, same FaceID, same wireless charging, same water resistance, same 5G support and everything else! Except that this is a smaller sized phone physically, which is so comfortable to hold that you'll wonder what happened to the smartphone industry getting obsessed over making bigger devices every year.    Fun fact : Literally 8 years ago in 2013 was when the iPhone 5S was announced. That was considered the gold standard in smartphone design. In 8 years we're carrying phones that are getting so uncomfortably big we have forgotten to use them with one hand. You know what's really funny? Human hands have stayed the same size in the last 8 years too. :D    You're not reading this for fun facts. You're really reading this review wondering if the battery life suffers because of the smaller battery on the mini compared to the regular sized iPhone 12. The simple answer - NOT REALLY!. Let me explain. Compared to the regular sized iPhone 12 - you will get ~1.5 hours less in terms of 100% - fully dead battery for the same level of usage on both phones. You can verify this via several YouTube channels that have tested this extensively. So basically for ~1.5 to 2 hours less battery life you get a phone that is so compact, without sacrificing anything else in terms of features. For me personally this means that I love my iPhone 12 mini. Convenience over 2 extra hours of battery life anyday for me. Plus I got a 20W fast charger that charges my mini from 10% - 100% in about ~45 minutes. My phone charges on Apple Carplay while I'm driving too. So 2 less hours of battery life is overrated for me. But you may disagree and that's fine.    Final verdict : If ~1.5 to 2 hours of extra battery backup along with a slightly bigger screen means more for you and how you want to use your phone, buy the regular sized iPhone 12. But for 2 hours less battery backup you prefer the convenience of carrying around a smaller, lighter phone that has everything that the regular 12 has, then buy the 12 mini without a doubt! This is a question of your priorities. ALSO if you're wondering if suddenly typing on a smaller screen will become an issue coming from a bigger phone, you could not be more wrong! It took me all of only 3 hours to get used to typing on this screen. Just FYI - I switched to this from a OnePlus 7T so I'm really speaking the truth. :D We tend to underestimate the ability of our brain and fingers on how quickly we can adapt to change. :D",7 months ago,511,2555
7122,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (White, 256 GB)",Na******************,4,Nice product,"As per my usage I think the battery is adequate as I don’t often use my phone and at the end of the as per my usage the battery percentage remains at 40% but if you are a heavy user then you might feel the drain. The screen is small and typing might be an issue but after few minutes on you’ll get used to it, the camera and the screen are awesome and the picture quality superb as per my liking. I would recommend a screen protector as minor scratches may occur, which might be caused while cleaning the dust off the phone etc. The price you are paying for a relatively small phone might give you a thought but it’s worth every penny. Light and durable phone and the shape reminds of the older IPhones the 5 & 5s for me which was the best designed iPhone ever regardless of the size",10 months ago,691,2764

7124,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (White, 256 GB)",Vi*******,1,Waste of money!,"Brilliant processor with a tiny battery.    Pro: This phone has the fastest processor in the world.  Con: With a tiny battery & small screen they aren’t pretty useful.    Pro: Supports Dolby Vision HDR Video recording and playback  Con: once you export the video to laptop or pendrive to watch it in big screen, dolby vision disappears from the video and it gets converted to SD. This defeats the whole purpose of having a dolby vision recording facility    Pro: low light photography is really good  Con: Photos no longer look natural. There’s some color correction happening and that makes the photo looks warmer.    Verdict: I purchased this phone considering the pocket friendly size of the phone and A14 chip. It was later I realised that with the tiny battery the phone actually throttles the cpu power. Hence I don’t see any magic happening while editing photos or videos. Export/Rendering time is same as that of iPhone 7 Plus.",6 months ago,196,196

Now coming to the product.  It comes with a charger,usb cable, sim ejecting pin, earphone and user manual.    The phone looks decent but the camera is so pathetic , It cant even match with 6k phone everything about phone camera is horrible.  The earphone provided is of very very cheap quality.  The icon of google search bar(widget) in the home screen can't be moved which looks disgusting.  It comes with a dual nano sim and with space for sd card and can be used all at once.

The speaker suddenly would stop working and then i have to restart the phone for it to work. Then, I initiate customer call and ask them for a replacement upon which they keep calling me with the same question ""may i know what your problem with the phone is sir?"" I have been a long time customer of flipkart and this has by far been the worst experience ever. There has been 2 technician visits even after which they won't approve the replacement because the technician could not identify the fault. I clearly mentioned earlier that, if I restart the phone it works. And the technician did that.. also reset my phone so that it would work. and it did. But keeping that as a factor they rejected the return. Now the same issue persists. I restart my phone about 15 times a day and I have made about 50 calls back and forth for addressing the query.

Some Bloatwares ( 7-8) and you can't disable them.  Full Screen Gestures not working flawlessly.  ....AND STILL DISCOVERING    Speaker is also nice but not very loud( Like Asus Max Pro M1)  Mediatek Helio G70 performance is also satisfactory( I dont play heavy games)  Software is also Fine.

7402,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Green, 256 GB)",Va************,5,Excellent Phone! Read My Review.,"If you're in the market for a compact phone with probably the best cameras in a phone today, that does not sacrifice on performance or any of the flagship features then your decision must start and end with an iPhone. First of all Apple has created something that is a throwback to the best smartphones ever designed - the iphone 5 and 5S. While doing so Apple made sure that it did not compromise on power or performance. The 12 mini has all the features (ALL OF THEM!) of the bigger iPhone 12 - so basically its the same A14 processor, same cameras, same RAM, same OLED screen, same FaceID, same wireless charging, same water resistance, same 5G support and everything else! Except that this is a smaller sized phone physically, which is so comfortable to hold that you'll wonder what happened to the smartphone industry getting obsessed over making bigger devices every year.    Fun fact : Literally 8 years ago in 2013 was when the iPhone 5S was announced. That was considered the gold standard in smartphone design. In 8 years we're carrying phones that are getting so uncomfortably big we have forgotten to use them with one hand. You know what's really funny? Human hands have stayed the same size in the last 8 years too. :D    You're not reading this for fun facts. You're really reading this review wondering if the battery life suffers because of the smaller battery on the mini compared to the regular sized iPhone 12. The simple answer - NOT REALLY!. Let me explain. Compared to the regular sized iPhone 12 - you will get ~1.5 hours less in terms of 100% - fully dead battery for the same level of usage on both phones. You can verify this via several YouTube channels that have tested this extensively. So basically for ~1.5 to 2 hours less battery life you get a phone that is so compact, without sacrificing anything else in terms of features. For me personally this means that I love my iPhone 12 mini. Convenience over 2 extra hours of battery life anyday for me. Plus I got a 20W fast charger that charges my mini from 10% - 100% in about ~45 minutes. My phone charges on Apple Carplay while I'm driving too. So 2 less hours of battery life is overrated for me. But you may disagree and that's fine.    Final verdict : If ~1.5 to 2 hours of extra battery backup along with a slightly bigger screen means more for you and how you want to use your phone, buy the regular sized iPhone 12. But for 2 hours less battery backup you prefer the convenience of carrying around a smaller, lighter phone that has everything that the regular 12 has, then buy the 12 mini without a doubt! This is a question of your priorities. ALSO if you're wondering if suddenly typing on a smaller screen will become an issue coming from a bigger phone, you could not be more wrong! It took me all of only 3 hours to get used to typing on this screen. Just FYI - I switched to this from a OnePlus 7T so I'm really speaking the truth. :D We tend to underestimate the ability of our brain and fingers on how quickly we can adapt to change. :D",7 months ago,511,2555
7403,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Green, 256 GB)",Na******************,4,Nice product,"As per my usage I think the battery is adequate as I don’t often use my phone and at the end of the as per my usage the battery percentage remains at 40% but if you are a heavy user then you might feel the drain. The screen is small and typing might be an issue but after few minutes on you’ll get used to it, the camera and the screen are awesome and the picture quality superb as per my liking. I would recommend a screen protector as minor scratches may occur, which might be caused while cleaning the dust off the phone etc. The price you are paying for a relatively small phone might give you a thought but it’s worth every penny. Light and durable phone and the shape reminds of the older IPhones the 5 & 5s for me which was the best designed iPhone ever regardless of the size",10 months ago,691,2764

7405,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Green, 256 GB)",Vi*******,1,Waste of money!,"Brilliant processor with a tiny battery.    Pro: This phone has the fastest processor in the world.  Con: With a tiny battery & small screen they aren’t pretty useful.    Pro: Supports Dolby Vision HDR Video recording and playback  Con: once you export the video to laptop or pendrive to watch it in big screen, dolby vision disappears from the video and it gets converted to SD. This defeats the whole purpose of having a dolby vision recording facility    Pro: low light photography is really good  Con: Photos no longer look natural. There’s some color correction happening and that makes the photo looks warmer.    Verdict: I purchased this phone considering the pocket friendly size of the phone and A14 chip. It was later I realised that with the tiny battery the phone actually throttles the cpu power. Hence I don’t see any magic happening while editing photos or videos. Export/Rendering time is same as that of iPhone 7 Plus.",6 months ago,196,196

YOU CAN GO FOR THIS. (gaming lovers should think on this)",9 months ago,633,2532

Read My Review.,"If you're in the market for a compact phone with probably the best cameras in a phone today, that does not sacrifice on performance or any of the flagship features then your decision must start and end with an iPhone. First of all Apple has created something that is a throwback to the best smartphones ever designed - the iphone 5 and 5S. While doing so Apple made sure that it did not compromise on power or performance. The 12 mini has all the features (ALL OF THEM!) of the bigger iPhone 12 - so basically its the same A14 processor, same cameras, same RAM, same OLED screen, same FaceID, same wireless charging, same water resistance, same 5G support and everything else! Except that this is a smaller sized phone physically, which is so comfortable to hold that you'll wonder what happened to the smartphone industry getting obsessed over making bigger devices every year.    Fun fact : Literally 8 years ago in 2013 was when the iPhone 5S was announced. That was considered the gold standard in smartphone design. In 8 years we're carrying phones that are getting so uncomfortably big we have forgotten to use them with one hand. You know what's really funny? Human hands have stayed the same size in the last 8 years too. :D    You're not reading this for fun facts. You're really reading this review wondering if the battery life suffers because of the smaller battery on the mini compared to the regular sized iPhone 12. The simple answer - NOT REALLY!. Let me explain. Compared to the regular sized iPhone 12 - you will get ~1.5 hours less in terms of 100% - fully dead battery for the same level of usage on both phones. You can verify this via several YouTube channels that have tested this extensively. So basically for ~1.5 to 2 hours less battery life you get a phone that is so compact, without sacrificing anything else in terms of features. For me personally this means that I love my iPhone 12 mini. Convenience over 2 extra hours of battery life anyday for me. Plus I got a 20W fast charger that charges my mini from 10% - 100% in about ~45 minutes. My phone charges on Apple Carplay while I'm driving too. So 2 less hours of battery life is overrated for me. But you may disagree and that's fine.    Final verdict : If ~1.5 to 2 hours of extra battery backup along with a slightly bigger screen means more for you and how you want to use your phone, buy the regular sized iPhone 12. But for 2 hours less battery backup you prefer the convenience of carrying around a smaller, lighter phone that has everything that the regular 12 has, then buy the 12 mini without a doubt! This is a question of your priorities. ALSO if you're wondering if suddenly typing on a smaller screen will become an issue coming from a bigger phone, you could not be more wrong! It took me all of only 3 hours to get used to typing on this screen. Just FYI - I switched to this from a OnePlus 7T so I'm really speaking the truth. :D We tend to underestimate the ability of our brain and fingers on how quickly we can adapt to change. :D",7 months ago,511,2555
7545,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Purple, 256 GB)",Na******************,4,Nice product,"As per my usage I think the battery is adequate as I don’t often use my phone and at the end of the as per my usage the battery percentage remains at 40% but if you are a heavy user then you might feel the drain. The screen is small and typing might be an issue but after few minutes on you’ll get used to it, the camera and the screen are awesome and the picture quality superb as per my liking. I would recommend a screen protector as minor scratches may occur, which might be caused while cleaning the dust off the phone etc. The price you are paying for a relatively small phone might give you a thought but it’s worth every penny. Light and durable phone and the shape reminds of the older IPhones the 5 & 5s for me which was the best designed iPhone ever regardless of the size",10 months ago,691,2764

7547,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Purple, 256 GB)",Vi*******,1,Waste of money!,"Brilliant processor with a tiny battery.    Pro: This phone has the fastest processor in the world.  Con: With a tiny battery & small screen they aren’t pretty useful.    Pro: Supports Dolby Vision HDR Video recording and playback  Con: once you export the video to laptop or pendrive to watch it in big screen, dolby vision disappears from the video and it gets converted to SD. This defeats the whole purpose of having a dolby vision recording facility    Pro: low light photography is really good  Con: Photos no longer look natural. There’s some color correction happening and that makes the photo looks warmer.    Verdict: I purchased this phone considering the pocket friendly size of the phone and A14 chip. It was later I realised that with the tiny battery the phone actually throttles the cpu power. Hence I don’t see any magic happening while editing photos or videos. Export/Rendering time is same as that of iPhone 7 Plus.",6 months ago,196,196

7768,"APPLE iPhone XR (White, 64 GB)",As***********,4,Wonderful,"Let’s keep it simple,  Phone is damn smooth and if you are coming from Android, you will really notice the difference no matter which smartphone you used earlier.  Pros:  1. Camera and image processing (portrait modes)  2. Battery (7hrs screen on time) i.e. all day battery life  3. iOS (If you are coming from Android, you will need 2 days to get used to it.. like gestures and all but once you are into it, there's no way turning back. Animations are refined and you will enjoy them)  4. Face ID is super fast and 100% secure  5. Performance is superior to most Android smartphone in market as of today in this price bracket. A12 it is !!  6. Speakers are excellent  7. Haptic feedback is next level. I can't explain in words.. in short it feels like someone is sitting inside and knocking phone's display 😂😂    Cons:  1. Glass back costs half price of phone itself if in case you end up shattering it  2. Phone is heavy.. 194 grams to be precise and when you add screen guard and back cover, it will add up and finally be around 210~230 grams  3. Battery charging is slow. Like what else will you expect from a 5w charger.  4. Front camera res is 7MP and will give you consistent results for 95% of time but for rest.. be prepared for some horrible selfies 😂    See, if you think that you are ok with a camera performance of 4/5, then blindly go with this phone. And if you are one who has camera as #1 priority then you must go for iPhone 11, it has better cameras.    Pro Tip: Don’t judge it’s display and camera based on just on paper specs and numbers. Both are excellent and 99% people won’t have any problem.  One more thing.. if possible go with a 128 gigs variant. iPhones eat lot of space !!","Aug, 2020",445,1780

7778,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Red, 256 GB)",Va************,5,Excellent Phone! Read My Review.,"If you're in the market for a compact phone with probably the best cameras in a phone today, that does not sacrifice on performance or any of the flagship features then your decision must start and end with an iPhone. First of all Apple has created something that is a throwback to the best smartphones ever designed - the iphone 5 and 5S. While doing so Apple made sure that it did not compromise on power or performance. The 12 mini has all the features (ALL OF THEM!) of the bigger iPhone 12 - so basically its the same A14 processor, same cameras, same RAM, same OLED screen, same FaceID, same wireless charging, same water resistance, same 5G support and everything else! Except that this is a smaller sized phone physically, which is so comfortable to hold that you'll wonder what happened to the smartphone industry getting obsessed over making bigger devices every year.    Fun fact : Literally 8 years ago in 2013 was when the iPhone 5S was announced. That was considered the gold standard in smartphone design. In 8 years we're carrying phones that are getting so uncomfortably big we have forgotten to use them with one hand. You know what's really funny? Human hands have stayed the same size in the last 8 years too. :D    You're not reading this for fun facts. You're really reading this review wondering if the battery life suffers because of the smaller battery on the mini compared to the regular sized iPhone 12. The simple answer - NOT REALLY!. Let me explain. Compared to the regular sized iPhone 12 - you will get ~1.5 hours less in terms of 100% - fully dead battery for the same level of usage on both phones. You can verify this via several YouTube channels that have tested this extensively. So basically for ~1.5 to 2 hours less battery life you get a phone that is so compact, without sacrificing anything else in terms of features. For me personally this means that I love my iPhone 12 mini. Convenience over 2 extra hours of battery life anyday for me. Plus I got a 20W fast charger that charges my mini from 10% - 100% in about ~45 minutes. My phone charges on Apple Carplay while I'm driving too. So 2 less hours of battery life is overrated for me. But you may disagree and that's fine.    Final verdict : If ~1.5 to 2 hours of extra battery backup along with a slightly bigger screen means more for you and how you want to use your phone, buy the regular sized iPhone 12. But for 2 hours less battery backup you prefer the convenience of carrying around a smaller, lighter phone that has everything that the regular 12 has, then buy the 12 mini without a doubt! This is a question of your priorities. ALSO if you're wondering if suddenly typing on a smaller screen will become an issue coming from a bigger phone, you could not be more wrong! It took me all of only 3 hours to get used to typing on this screen. Just FYI - I switched to this from a OnePlus 7T so I'm really speaking the truth. :D We tend to underestimate the ability of our brain and fingers on how quickly we can adapt to change. :D",7 months ago,511,2555
7779,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Red, 256 GB)",Na******************,4,Nice product,"As per my usage I think the battery is adequate as I don’t often use my phone and at the end of the as per my usage the battery percentage remains at 40% but if you are a heavy user then you might feel the drain. The screen is small and typing might be an issue but after few minutes on you’ll get used to it, the camera and the screen are awesome and the picture quality superb as per my liking. I would recommend a screen protector as minor scratches may occur, which might be caused while cleaning the dust off the phone etc. The price you are paying for a relatively small phone might give you a thought but it’s worth every penny. Light and durable phone and the shape reminds of the older IPhones the 5 & 5s for me which was the best designed iPhone ever regardless of the size",10 months ago,691,2764

7781,"APPLE iPhone 12 Mini (Red, 256 GB)",Vi*******,1,Waste of money!,"Brilliant processor with a tiny battery.    Pro: This phone has the fastest processor in the world.  Con: With a tiny battery & small screen they aren’t pretty useful.    Pro: Supports Dolby Vision HDR Video recording and playback  Con: once you export the video to laptop or pendrive to watch it in big screen, dolby vision disappears from the video and it gets converted to SD. This defeats the whole purpose of having a dolby vision recording facility    Pro: low light photography is really good  Con: Photos no longer look natural. There’s some color correction happening and that makes the photo looks warmer.    Verdict: I purchased this phone considering the pocket friendly size of the phone and A14 chip. It was later I realised that with the tiny battery the phone actually throttles the cpu power. Hence I don’t see any magic happening while editing photos or videos. Export/Rendering time is same as that of iPhone 7 Plus.",6 months ago,196,196

Call quality is good  IR blaster working fine.    Cons :  Heating issue they need to fix it heats a lost especially when you touch the back camera (a lot) need to fix it with an update. Note : it depends upon the surrounding  Speaker not as expected  Ui if you push the device hard by playing games continuously or jumping between apps you may see some stutters and even tends to freeze hope they can fix with an update  Finger print sensor not accurate most of the time fails to open.  Camera bump may get some scratches (use it in a proper way)  Note  : if you are okay with this case means no problem  But you can't able to put a full tempered on this because this case use to grab some space on the 4 sides of the corner. So it is not possible to have a full tempered if you are using this case.

Full HD+ screen is very bright and Colors are accurate and crisp.  2) glass back feels premium.  3) notch is very tiny, it looks nice but as of now while writing this review miui has no option to hide the notch yet. I know many people would like to disable the notch. In future through software update may be Xiaomi would fix this.  4) sound quality is okay. not great and not bad.  5) software : Android pie out of the box with miui 10.  6) security patch level is of 5-1-2019 out of the box.  7) The in box cover is okay type but I would recommend buy a proper case very soon. The one in the box will not give proper protection.  8) headset: The headphone output is very good I would say.  9) Network: volte for my jio and Airtel working great. Call experiences great too.  10)*advertisements*: make sure you disable every ""receive recommendation* option in system application section so that you don't see advertisements.  11) camera:see the photo's yourself( shot on gcam) I have not edited them. photo's are simply outstanding with gcam even with the nightmode. don't trust every Youtubers who are just biased with brands and models.  note * the are many gcam versions *  12) charging: it takes about 2hours to go full charge. 0-60 percentage takes about 40mins.  *type c* cable makes it more of a modern device.  lastly go for it guys it's a value for money device.  this device looks and feels such premium.  ****Lastly battery life... it is decent, will last a day or two easily. *****  *Go for it*","Mar, 2019",1504,7520

Device build is nice although front and back are gorilla glass protected and side bezels are plastic but not feels like plastic. Preinstalled camera app is garbage, Camera is excellent only if you use gcam port of pixel 3 xl, working perfectly for me. Display is bright and vibrant but in sunlight reflection is very high. Performance is very good because of good processor pubg run smooth but 3gb ram causing problems and performance is decreasing because of 3gb ram and framedrops can seen clearly so install few apps for smooth pubg experience. Speaker is descent but calling speaker of front is not that loud. Battery lasts for one day easily, and also type c fast charge and hybrid slot is there. Finally overall nice device to use everything is fine for light use but if you are hard user then ram is not sufficient only few apps run at a time, so go for 4gb instead of 3gb ram.

7943,"Redmi Note 7 (Onyx Black, 32 GB)",Sa********,4,Good choice,"Got it on the first day, fortunately I got it ordered.  The biggest update on this phone is the usb type C port.  First of all the phone looks quite premium with minimal bezels and sleek design. It's little bit slippery also. Phone boots quite fast.  Though I am not a fan of MIUI but still it gets the job done.  Camera takes very nice pictures, though I didnt like the portrait mode much.  Didn't test the battery, but as per specs it should easily last a day and half on moderate usage.  The display is above 6'' and the quality is crystal clear.  You will get a 5V 2Amp normal charger and a case.  Nothing to say about the processor. It will play ping in HD graphics easily.  Now the only con that I found is the heating issue, as soon as I got it, I put it on charge. The phone was in switch off mode but it still heated, not much but it did heat a little and the charger heated also. So after all these pros, I found a con and that may get resolved by some future update.  thanks for reading","Mar, 2019",63,252

This mobile is not fully optimised which sd778 is cable of. Battery drain,poor camera, no dual speakers or dolby enhancement. Yes this is 25k device with no dual speaker. Lets talk about cameras. The camera lacks details or sharpness and the saturation of each photos you take looks unnatural. My old Redmi note 7 pro takes better pictures than this.    Verdic: if you are getting it on offer price you can try experiencing sd778 however there are lots of other phones with ssd and great sets of cameras and other features.

Now I feel like rocket speed. 120hz display feels so smooth.    The Inbuilt photo editing is just super. Photos are bit saturated and its fine.    With huge display i feel Its very lightweight in hand.  When I watch full screen videos I can feel the corners are bit more rounded and its also just fine.  Speakers are good and both side speakers gives equal sounds.  It has 4G+ and downloading speeds are better than Samsung M31s.  Battery charges 0 to 100% at around 1 hour 45mins.    Gaming is very smooth. In PUBG I felt some minor normal frame drop some times and its just fine.  Bluetooth connection is good. With one plus wireless bullet Z I am getting very low latency in PUBG (In m31s it was really bad).    Only I felt problem is you can set AOD to 10 seconds only.,5 months ago,295,1180

Qualcomm snapdragon 625 rocks, battery is best in class under 18k i think only lenovo p2 is better back up than this one. i bought 32gb /3gb variant.  camera is better than note 3 but if you are camera buddy than increase your budget 2k and buy honor 6x.but for a normal person and for a normal selfie taker person wouldn't disappointed about camera. low light photography improved very much. note 3 might having 16 mp camera but 13 mp note 4 camera is way better and the difference of pics easily shows. video recording is ok but mic quality is awesome. dont get overexite avoylut slow motion recording its just an entry level slow motion recording.  dual apps and second space is one of the most special feature of miui according to me. the second best ui in android(cynogen/oxygen hold rank 1)  display quality very nice  sound is way better than note 3 and placement of speaker in the bottom looks premium.  now i directly tell you pros and cons  marks  1.look and build quality 9/10  2.rear cam 7/10  3.front cam 8/10  4.miui 10/10  5.speaker 9/10  6.call quality and signal strength 9.5/10  7.display 9.5/10  8.battery back up 10.99/10  now i tell you why you should buy redmi note 4(pros)  customizable  battery back up  decent sound quality  made in india  custom roms, accessories flooding  nought update  no heating yes no heating issue while playing heavy games thanks to finfet technology  vr support  why you shouldn't buy redmi note4  hybrid sim just hate that technology  nfc unsupported  fast charging unsupported  complicated ui for those who used their phone only for calling surfing texting this ui is not for you.  decent camera but i previously mention if your first priority is camera than opt honor 6x.  verdict: at ₹10999 redmi note 4 is surely best in class many phones may be beat them in on functionality but in terms of head to head with in 14 k this is the best.

After getting the desired Results, I Purchased 3GB-32GB version from Flipkart for my Father.  Following are the Observations,  Pros:  1) All 3 versions have Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 64 bit Processor(2ghz Octa core).  # This Processor perfectly balances the Battery life & Performance.  2) Screen is 5.5inches 2.5d slightly Curved at the edges.  3) Has memory expansion option upto 128GB ( Hybrid slot).  4) Most Importantly Battery Life is 20% Better than Note 3, beause of Snapdragon 625 Processor.  ( Check the Genuine Battery Perfomance stats below the Cons )  5) Built Quality is Improved over Redmi Note 3.  6) Finger Print sensor is Lightening Quick.  7) Phone Handles Heavy games like NOVA, Modern Combact 5, Ashpalt 8, etc Smoothly.  8) With heavy multitasking NO LAGS Detected yet.  9) Also NO Substantial Heating Noted.  10) Camera Quality is reasonable for the Price and Better than Note 3.  11) Has Lots of sensor like accelerometer, gyro, Infrared Blastor, etc.  12) Supports Dual Sim.I am Using JIO Sim with it and I get good Performance.  13) Device gets Regular Software Updates.  Cons:  1) NO Quick Charging Supported.  2) Video Recording Quality is Not that Good.Honor 6x & Moto g4+ has Better camera Quality.  # I certainly Not Recommend it for Vloging.  3) Back is bit Slippery.  4) Can't Get Same Performance with 2GB Ram version (my friend has one).  5) No Earphone Inlcuded in Package.  6) Display is NOT Corning Gorila Glass, which makes it vulnerable to Damage.  7) 4GB version gives 2.2GB max. Ram even if All Apps are closed.  8) Design is Very Similar to Note 3.  Battery Performance Stats:  # Charging from 0 to 100% takes 2hrs 30mins. with 2Amp stock charger.  # Battery Performance is Better than Note 3 & Redmi 3s Prime, even if Battery is Same(4100mah).  Usage Mode ---> Battery Performance(Avg.)  =============================================================================  @ Mobile Data(3g/4g) Used Continously ---> 9 Hrs.  @ Mobile Data ON + GPS ON + Normal Calling ---> Roughly 1.5 Days.  @ Normal Calling Only + Standby ---> Almost 2 Days.  @ Normal Calling + Music Playback( Continuous ) ---> 9 Hrs.  @ Internet Usage on WiFi Only( No Calling ) ---> 12 Hrs.  @ Gaming ( Wifi) ---> 7-8.5 Hrs.  @ Gaming ( without WiFi ) ---> 8-9.5 Hrs.  @ Video Playback ---> 13 Hrs.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  VERDICT:  If you Already have Redmi Note 3 or 3s Prime, then Don't Buy it.  If you are purchasing your 1st MI phone, then Definitely Go For it.  DO NOT Purchase 2GB Version, you won't get Best Performance out of it.  Atleast Purchase 3GB Version.  Finally, for Battery Hunters. If Not satisfied with this Beast, then they can go for Lenovo P2.  It will give you 4+ Hrs of Performance compared to Redmi Note 4.    If you find this review Helpful, then Please Hit YES/Helpful Button.  Thank You for reading this Review.","Mar, 2017",4113,20565

8070,"Redmi Note 4 (Gold, 32 GB)",Lo*******,4,Read it before u buy it.... Clarifies all ur doubts...,"If u r really interested in the device read it because its a very long detailed review....    But before review let me answer 2 qtns  Is it worth the money?  Yes, off course..... no doubt in that.... but Please choose between 3gb and 4 gb variant..... not the 2 gb one please  Is it worth upgrading fron redmi note 3?  No....not much improvement in the redmi note 4 compared to note 3.....so upgrading is not worth it  Unboxing:  Handset - I have purchased the redmi note 4 3/32 gb dark grey variant for 10999 rs. Delivered on 25th jan 2017.  No earphones.... but everyone know it.... not a surprise...  Usb cable(good qwality, may be 1 mtr lenght)  Travel adapter( its a 2A adapter that means this handset has fast charging but not quick charge like in leeco le2) ...  Battery is builtin and non removable  User guide and no screen protector (quite disappointing)  as soon as u setup ur device u will get a 1.4 gb update..... do take the ota update....    Reviewing after 1 day usage  Body:  It has speakers placed at edge....  but the device is not completely metak body and has plastic at top and bottom and metal at the backside centre.  U can see this design in indian variants.... may be due to cost cutting..... but visually u dont find any difference with the mobile body.... so no worries  Volte (9/10)  Both sims support 4g volte..... no issue with the call qwality..... voice over lte works fine and u can use ur jio sim to call fron the default dialer without turning on mobile data  IR blaster:(9/10)  Good feature and mi has a pre installed remote app.... but its not a universal remote though.....  Setting this for a new device is bit uneasy..... but once u set it u can through ur old remote and use ur mobile to control all ur devices.    Display :(9/10)  2.5d glass covering the sharp hp display.....no issue with the viewing angles..... has led indicator and supports all the colors.....u can customize the color of led light witb respect to different apps and different functionalities    Sound:(9.5/10)  Speaker output is very good.... No issues with it.... side speakers avoids sound muffles...  Earphn output is also good ....it supports all d earphns.... I tested my samung and philips earphn.... It works well the pause and play button works and even the volume contrl button of the earphn works.....    Camera:(8/10)  Gives very good photos under day light.... In nights only closeup shots appear good....low light Images are soft and not really sharp.....front cam clicks good selfies.... Selfie lovers vil not be disappointed  Battety:(9/10)  Its 4100 mah battery and battery backup is really impressive and but the charge timing is quite disappointing .... It charges from 5% to 100% in 2hour and 25 minutes...  Software :  It runs on 6.0.1 Marshmallow .... Very less bloatwares installed and almost 1.3 gb of ram free even on running 8 to 10 apps in the background.... Its confirmed from xiomi that the redmi note 4 will soon receive the andorid N update.  Hardware:  I'm a not a geek and I dont play heavy games but played spiderman and asphault 8(medium graphics) .... But it doesn't heat up much..... so snapdragon 625 is a good move by xiomi  Sim card slots:  It has hybrid sim slot.... So u can use 2 sims or a sd card and a sim.... Both the sim support 4g.... I have tested it with airtel 4g and jio 4g  Call quality :(9/10)  Call quality is good.... No issues and it has 2 microphones.... 4g and 3 g signal reception is also good....volte call qwality is good....    Fingerprint sensor:(10/10)  Its far far better than one plus three finger print sensor.... It detects ur finger at any degree and even the sweaty fingers.... It unlocks the device instantly in less than micro secs.... U can select other operations for ur finger like opening an app directly from lock screen.... calling a number directly.... it also has inbuilt fingerprint app locker..... But this fingerprint app locker is buggy..... once u open a locked app then even if u close and open it again it wont ask for fingerprint unless u lock and unlock the phn again.... this bug may be fixed in next ota update.    Conclusion  Cons:  1. quick charge technology missing .....really a much needed one for this 4100 gaint battery......In the same price segment u get quick charging in leeco le2 which charges the device in 1.30 hrs.... but this takes around 2.40 hrs to charge completely  2.Setting up the mi remote for a new device.... quite tedious job...    3.Buggy inbuilt app locker..  4.Not upto the expectation low light camera.....  Pros:  Battery backup  speaker qwality and its placement  Fingerprint sensor  Ir blaster....  as usual the miui customisations","Jan, 2017",820,3280
8071,"Redmi Note 4 (Gold, 32 GB)",Sa*****,5,Highly recommended,"Very excited that I got in the first Mi note4 flash sale on Flipkart.Got the product next day.,thanks flipkart.  Now talking about pros and cons I can tell that what's so special and do you need to buy.  Pros:  1)Best display in price point.  2)best viewing angle and touch is awesome bcoz of the curved glass (2.5).  3)camera is decent just lower than moto g4 plus since my friend has it.  4)speaker is decent.  5)fingerprint works faster.  6)no heat or lag compared to other, thanks to 625 processor used.  7)Design of phone has improved than mi note3, slimmer.  8)Finally the battery life is crazy. Awesome.  Cons:  1)fast charging should have been included.sad to see that.  2)camera should have improved.  3)No hope of protection if the phone fells, bit slippery...  THATS it guys hope u get it in flash sale.  Now final verdict is If you dont have Redmi note3 than this is the perfect phone for you.  If u have Redmi note 3, as my sister has I noticed that there is bit diff in design front glass and huge improvement in camera, which you'll notice much in low light.  Other than that 625 processor and better battery efficiency, I can tell that there is no need to upgrade to mi note4. Thank you. Like this..","Jan, 2017",360,1800

Also 0-100 in just 1 hour 10 mins  CAMERA - 2/5 Rear camera works very good in good lighting but when light is low, its horrible. Not like a 108mp.  Front camera is worse. Selfies look very weird and very warm color.  I think these will be fixed with software updates.  PERFORMANCE - 4.5/5 Performance is good. No lags and stutter till now. 90hz works very smooth.  DISPLAY - 5/5 Display is very good. Colors are vibrant.  FINGER PRINT SCANNER AND GESTURES -4.5/5 Finger print works good and is fast. The gestures are very good and useful.  SPEAKER AND HEADPHONES EXPERIENCE - 4/5 Speaker is loud but a stereo speaker would have been better but this one is also gets the job done. Headphone experience is also good.    1 thing I noticed is that the wifi speed never reaches the maximum speed. I have a 30mbps wifi, max speed I was getting was 25-26mbps while in other phones I was getting 30mbps. This is a bit of problem but in normal use it's not noticeable.    In conclusion I would say that if camera is not your priority and you want a clean software experience, then this phone is perfect you.  If camera issues are fixed with update, then this can become a very good allrounder.",2 months ago,752,3008

I am very much satisfied with this. Whether it be performance , display (too op !!!!), and the software ( it feels very light and smooth), the display is simply amazing. Rear camera performance is descent, only problem is in the front camera's performance. Basically hardware is top notch, no problem with that, the only thing needed is a software update for the front camera performance. I'll edit my comment to 5 star if moto provides update for the camera 🙌🙌🙌✌️. And yes it has got descent haptics, feels very pleasing. And you actually feel that you have got control over your data, it gives you full privacy, you can really manage all the permissions that apps are accessing. Huge thumbs up for moto's clean software and thinkshield privacy...Trust me guys software matters a lot, don't just compare stuff on the basis of hardware specs.  Here I am attaching some of the 108 MP rear camera shots and macro shots.    *****EDIT:- So moto did provide with couple of camera updates and it appears to have made things much better. So I am editing my comment to ""5 Star"" as I mentioned. Also you can use the gcam modes which are available now for moto edge 20 fusion to get the results as per your taste.",2 months ago,255,1275
8126,"MOTOROLA Edge 20 Fusion (Cyber Teal, 128 GB)",AJ*************,4,Nice product,Edge 20 Fusion is cool enough.... Gives the best performance with its performance..... Except the camera.... The 108mp camera is not at all good.... It can't even focus properly.... It takes 2 to 3 sec for processing the image after taking the photo.... And still you won't be satisfied with it.... Even the selfie camera is not that good.... It doesn't have wide angle feature.... Coming to the video section it does pretty well and it is impressing.... Even the 4k videos are also damn cool.... The speakers are also loud enough....Battery is also good easily usable for 24-30hrs.... The charger is becoming warm while charging... Don't know why.... But it is charging quickly....

8127,"MOTOROLA Edge 20 Fusion (Cyber Teal, 128 GB)",De*************,5,Just wow!,Moto has worked quite a bit on this one. This one is surprisingly light and has a balanced matte finish on the back. Display is oled 10 bit with striking color contrast and media consumption is very appealing to eye. Processor is 5g compliant and is quite capable in multitasking and gaming too. No heating issue felt so far. 30 watt turbocharger is handy. Battery will last more than a day easily. Camera rear side is decent and gives you pics close to real objects without any added enhancement. Front camera is a bit weak but can be improved with updates. Ready for pc feature is an add on which is cool too. Carrier aggregation and nfc support with headphone jack is very assuring too on this one. Go for it if u need a clean stock Android experience with better display and a capable 5g processor. Regards.,2 months ago,20,100

The zoom is incredible I had a Motorola before this as well and the camera was great, I'd say the camera quality is comparable to that of Iphone with better zoom and saturation  2. The ready for PC feature is one of a kind and really good for saving time and you can control your PC with the phone completely wireless  3.

8130,"MOTOROLA Edge 20 Fusion (Cyber Teal, 128 GB)",Sa********,4,Nice product,"Well I am clean UI midrange user from the earlier. Xperia,Lenovo,Asus were my previous smartphones.I wanted a proper replacement for my Asus max pro m2 as there were no update since two years. It was like a hell to use that backdated ph but the no compromise Sony's sensor and 1.8 aperture. Realme GT Master edition n Moto fusion were my two targets. One of my priority is always a camera. Fusion camera review made me too much confusion but accidentally I placed this order.    I will not elaborate about other features of this ph but the most confusing Camera performance. Well 1st I will like to say that it's aperture is 1.9 so you can't expect better low light performance at night or good bokeh effect at day light. Even I found uneven focusing problems . Bugs in pro mode also need to be fixed. There is a serious problem in when you controlling shutter speed with ISO. Must be fixed.But there is a solution of every problems. Tht is Gcam. You will found the difference. But no option to manually control the camera in Gcam. I have taken so many types shots both at Gcam n system camera during light and day. One thing I can say it can't expect 5 star or even2 star rating for camera performance. It can be managed. As other features of this ph is superb. Last thing they have other high range phs. All good features in midrange ph will definitely effect higher budget ph. So acco to geekyranjit no ph is perfect.    Cons:  Bluetooth connectivity problems, problem in auto brightness , screen is not enough bright for outdoor, the number 108 mp makes me irritating every time.  Most annoying part is high SAR value in this segment",26 days ago,21,84

8274,"APPLE iPhone XR ((PRODUCT)RED, 64 GB)",As***********,4,Wonderful,"Let’s keep it simple,  Phone is damn smooth and if you are coming from Android, you will really notice the difference no matter which smartphone you used earlier.  Pros:  1. Camera and image processing (portrait modes)  2. Battery (7hrs screen on time) i.e. all day battery life  3. iOS (If you are coming from Android, you will need 2 days to get used to it.. like gestures and all but once you are into it, there's no way turning back. Animations are refined and you will enjoy them)  4. Face ID is super fast and 100% secure  5. Performance is superior to most Android smartphone in market as of today in this price bracket. A12 it is !!  6. Speakers are excellent  7. Haptic feedback is next level. I can't explain in words.. in short it feels like someone is sitting inside and knocking phone's display 😂😂    Cons:  1. Glass back costs half price of phone itself if in case you end up shattering it  2. Phone is heavy.. 194 grams to be precise and when you add screen guard and back cover, it will add up and finally be around 210~230 grams  3. Battery charging is slow. Like what else will you expect from a 5w charger.  4. Front camera res is 7MP and will give you consistent results for 95% of time but for rest.. be prepared for some horrible selfies 😂    See, if you think that you are ok with a camera performance of 4/5, then blindly go with this phone. And if you are one who has camera as #1 priority then you must go for iPhone 11, it has better cameras.    Pro Tip: Don’t judge it’s display and camera based on just on paper specs and numbers. Both are excellent and 99% people won’t have any problem.  One more thing.. if possible go with a 128 gigs variant. iPhones eat lot of space !!","Aug, 2020",445,1780

The delivery was on time and I came in good packaging  2. First impression were awesome the display is not as bad as it is written in the spec list it’s the high quality LCD Panel that you will get in any phone and using dark made/light mode will not make any difference since it’s an LCD panel  3. Cameras were excellent even in the night 5? I have also uploaded some sample images  4. Performance mind blowing Apple A13 chip is super fast everything is buttery smooth  5. Battery 3110 mah and the optimisation of Apple and IOS 13 you will get good battery life and you will not get fast charger out of box you have to buy this separately    The final thing I wanna say is if you are on a budget of 60-70 go for the iPhone 11 and If you have enough money go for the iPhone 11 Pro Max don’t buy the iPhone 11 Pro (My opinion)  Or you can get iPhone 11 and Apple Watch series 5 with same price of 11 pro  The phone is great you will not regret after buying it go for it ??,"Jan, 2020",4558,22790

If you can survive with an HD+ LCD panel with thicker bezels and a notch up top then this is a very good phone for you.  Cameras are awesome, battery backup excellent, great performance and a decent premium look. Good job Apple !","Nov, 2019",4883,24415

Pros:  1. Camera and image processing (portrait modes)  2. Battery (7hrs screen on time) i.e. all day battery life  3. iOS (If you are coming from Android, you will need 2 days to get used to it.. like gestures and all but once you are into it, there's no way turning back.

Glass back costs half price of phone itself if in case you end up shattering it  2. Phone is heavy.. 194 grams to be precise and when you add screen guard and back cover, it will add up and finally be around 210~230 grams  3. Battery charging is slow.

Front camera res is 7MP and will give you consistent results for 95% of time but for rest.. be prepared for some horrible selfies 😂    See, if you think that you are ok with a camera performance of 4/5, then blindly go with this phone. And if you are one who has camera as #1 priority then you must go for iPhone 11, it has better cameras.    Pro Tip: Don’t judge it’s display and camera based on just on paper specs and numbers.

8363,"Tecno POVA (DAZZLE BLACK, 64 GB)",P *****,5,Highly recommended,My honest review.  Pros:  Big Display  6000 mah battery  Good charge speed 18W  Notification light  4 Camera with front Punch hole cam looks good.  Feels bit Light weight after having 6000mah battery  Best processor at this price. Helio G80  Many features included.    Cons:  Some unwanted pre-installed apps some are Chinese.  Camera is good but not best.  Only 720p video support. Display Quality is Ok but I'm an OnePlus user I can't compare with a 40k mobile so still it's good display at 10k price.    I will suggest this mobile for basic user like family members who needs long battery backup with bigger display.Not for heavy graphic gamers can run games like pubg but not in high quality graphic and display doesn't have high sensitivity rate.    Finally If you want phone at 10k price point no phone can beat this mobile. As per the Spec. I bet.,10 months ago,574,2870

8407,"Redmi Note 7 (Sapphire Blue, 64 GB)",Vi*********,5,Excellent,"I'm not much of a critic, but more of a fair reviewer.  I'll put in some details as well. Let's get started.    Btw, I have the 4GB ram variant and Onyx Black back.    Camera:-    Seriously, it is better than I expected. After going through a plethora of reviews regarding the sub-par and surprisingly pathetic performance of the Camera(and recommendations of buying Pro instead), I did not expect too much. But the Camera, for its price range as well as generally speaking, is quite good. Even the front Camera is capable of clicking fabulous images. Video recording is also very good.  At least 4.5/5 from my side.    Processor:-    Already tested heavy-hitter games like Asphault and Pubg. QSD 660 AIE is perfect! No issues YET. I 'might' edit my review after a month, and then after 3-4 months. Not sure. However, right now I have absolutely no issues with processor at all. Every single task runs smoothly and instantaneously.  A very easy 5/5 from my side.    Battery:-    Well, it takes 2 hours to charge from 0 to 100. (from switched-off mode of mobile)  Not spectacular. Battery is as battery should be.  Quick Charge 4 support is there, however charger is not available in India. QC 3 charger is available at MI official site for Rs.499 + 50 (shipping charges). I would recommend you to wait for QC 4 charger tho.  So, I guess it's a 4.5/5? Yup.    Outer Design and all that :-    Not much to say. Compared to other Redmi mobiles, this one (and Pro too) has quite a premium look. Feels great to use this. Doesn't AT ALL look like a 12K phone. And I'm talking about Onyx Black only, so ;)  Solid 5/5 here!    Hmm...all in all, the 4.5 overall rating on Flipkart for this mobile isn't fake. It is much deserved. 6.3 inches is a liiiitle big for me, but I'll adjust. Idk why people complain about the Notch and all. Learn to adjust, idiots!  Also, fingerprint is super fast and face unlock is also quite fast. And the ""Ads issue"" that people hace complained about is present, true, but not as much as people made it to be.  Exaggeration level 999, people. *slow claps*  No laggs and no heating as well. This one was unexpected really. I think Xiaomi really did go all-out on this one. THANKS, XIAOMI. APPRECIATE IT.    Overall, a complete BOMB at 12K only.  Much deserved.    People, you seriously do not require a Qualcomm SnapDragon 675 at all. 660 is truly ENOUGH!  And that 48 MP Camera is not really something to hype about, really. Improve your own quality as a mobile photographer. Hmph! 48MP is just for show.  And this is why I didn't go for Note 7 Pro.  (Go watch a few YouTube videos if not convinced :p)    Thanks for reading so far. Enjoy your day. Ciao :)","Apr, 2019",148,740
8408,"Redmi Note 7 (Sapphire Blue, 64 GB)",Fl***************,4,Worth the money,"In my brief usage of around 8-9 days, i can definitely assure you that you can buy this phone, it's just one of the best in this price segment.  1.Performance is just flawless, no issues & i m not a hardcore gamer but a medium player & while playing pubg in hd graphics, it just play smoothly no frame drops.  2. Screen is super smooth & both front & back looks premium & sturdy.  3. Camera is also decent enough for the price, if you are a normal user like me who clicks photos occasionally, this camera will not disappoint you. It's front & rear camera both works fine no issues.  But i would like to mention that low light photos aren't that good but m sure it will get good with software upgrade.  4. Battery Backup is also good. It lasted me whole day in medium to heavy usage. It even lasted me 1.5 day while in medium usage.  5. No such heating issues faced till now for medium usage, but yeah it got little heated when played pubg in high graphics continuously for 1.5 - 2 hrs which I think is fine then.  So all in all its a great budget phone, just go for it but if you are a photographer kind of person or highly photogenic then go for Redmi Note 7 pro with 2000 more bucks.    Note: While installing the phone disable all the recommendations which the Redmi pre selected to avoid ads.","Apr, 2019",79,316

Go for it..,First of all thanks to God that i succeed to get it in the first sale and within 24 hours of ordering....:D  Everything is awesome including Flipkart delivery service....  Let's talk about the phone.. In short it's a beast in this price no other device at this price segment can beat this....  I liked it very much let's be in pros and cons...  Pros:  1. Look & Build: obviously it looks very premium in and feel and look-wise.... Specially Gorilla glass on back makes it premium.... It has very good build quality...  2. Battery: It's awesome you won't regret as it has 4000mAh battery as it supports 18W(9V*2A) Quick charge 4.0.... When i unboxed it was 51% and it reached 100% in around 45 minutes with 4.0 quick charge.... So i think it'll take around one an half hour from 0 to 100.......  3. Performance: It has Snap 660 so i haven't seen any lag when i played Pubg... Xiaomi has improved the quality of light sensor and it works very fast when we switch from dark to light or light to dark... Face unlock and fingerprint both are also very responsive...  4.

Prospective buyers can then decide    1. For photo and video enthusiasts. Very reliable camera. Fast and excellent picture quality. Videos are absolutely stable and professional quality. You would be amazed how many people shoot Youtube videos on an iPhone. The only downside is that the display doesn’t do justice to the photos and videos you have taken. Night photos are also not that great but if you get Neural cam app for 400 bucks its well worth it.    2. Very reliable performance. No lag whatsoever. All major apps work better than android counterparts. Internet connection is also more stable. It functions exactly how a smartphone should be.    3. Its fun when you have more apple devices. I have an iPad and airdrop is an amazing feature    4. For those who don’t want to lug a heavy oversized phone in your pocket and but needs all that high end power in a compact form, this phone is the perfect choice.    5. For those who don’t play heavy games and media consumption is moderate. Isn’t that how life supposed to be? More living and less glued to your phone? This is one of the main reasons I switched to this phone. Reduce your big screen and media consumption addiction.    6. If you are okay with charging every night after a day of moderate usage.

8432,"SAMSUNG Galaxy On7 (Gold, 8 GB)",An****************,5,6 months usage review updated + Marshmallow Update,"Got marshmallow update for my On7, around 800MB, Seriously am loving this phone more now,everything is smooth and fine.      I was using a galaxy core i8262 and decided for a small upgrade as its more than 2 years old now,So went with this one.  I was looking for a phone with a min of 2gb ram. Lots of options are available like the K3 Note, Xiomi Mi,Zenphone etc but the main thing which is important to me was the availability of service centers in my city,thats why i went with samsung.  Came to see on5 in flipkart at an offer price of 8990/-. upon reading its reviews and comparison with on7. i came to know that on7 got better CPU than on5, though both has only 1.5gb ram,i dont use much apps on phone,just some basic apps like fb,whatsapp,imo, shareit,cam scanner,instagram etc so i thought the 1.5gb ram wont be an issue for me. I dont game on mobile,so no comments on gaming.Again i strongly suggest you to get a 2gb ram phone if you do gaming.  Looks: Coming to the phone,Its looks boxy,rechangle in shape which i like very much, it depents on personal taste and i like this shape very much. back panel is plastic just like my old phone so it doesnt matter for me.  Screen: is a 720P TFT Display which also felt very good ,has good colors and very good touch response.  Internal Memory : Available free memory is only 4.29GB,again as i said before wont be an issue for me as my application installation wont exceed more than 2gb. also bought a samsung class 10 32GB memory card,which is giving 23MB/s write speed and 70MB/s read speed as per sd benchmarking app.  Interface: UI is lag free,no lags noticed while normal use,app installation and all.  Camera: Both front cam and rear cam is very good for the price,both supports 1080p video recording.front cam also have a 120 degree selfie mode which is really good. beauty face feature is also available. The rear cam is a bit protruded so make sure to get a good case otherwise you will end up with a scratched cam lens.  Battery: is a 3000mah battery,charged for 6hrs and after that i turned on wifi and started installing all my fav apps on the phone,made calls,clicked photos still 50% remaining when it completed one day of use. am really happy with battery performance.Overnight battery usage is just 1-2%, from 11pm to morning 7am.  RAM: the main thing everyone is worried about, after installing all apps ( about 2gb) still free ram is 550MB before clearing ram and after cleaning,more than 700MB is available for use.even after opening all apps like fb,messenger etc,still got 300mb ram free. which is very impressive,i guess lollipop is doing very good ram management.  OTG: This phone supports OTG too, but only FAT file system i think because when i connected my NTFS formated pen drive,it said unsupported file system.  Call Quality: Call quality was the main thing i was worried about this phone as i could not find a review here, Call quality of this phone is very good and clear voice, call quality was poor when i used a friends k3 note. only thing i felt was ,the call speaker is so loud than someone standing near can hear whats the other guy is telling us. again which can be solved by reducing the volume i guess.  Loudspeaker: Loudspeaker is average i guess, Core was also having very low sound, This one is much better than core.its ok,nothing to worry on it. Still samsung is nowhere near lenovo phone loud speakers.  Heating: The phone doesnt heats up, Just a small warmth only when kept in hands for a ling time,dont know whether its because of the climate here, No other heating,Didnt tried gaming,No heating during calls too,Phone remained cool even after on call for 30mins.  Size and Weight: Phone feels bit heavy at 172gms and 5.5"" is bit big too. But i have big hands so no problem for me even for single handed use. 5.5"" screen and big keypad made typing easier for me.  After 6 months:  No heating issues, never hanged or restarted, never reset till date and everything is fine and error free. Very good battery backup, camera isnt that great during low light conditions, but very good on sunny days and under good lighting. Front cam is very good. No signal problems, works fine with 4g too. Internal memory is less, only 2gb is free for me, if its a problem for you.otherwise no worries.no software issues. No battery drainibg issues, still overnight drain is just 1%, max 2% in 10hours. Display colours isnt that vibrant as amoled displays like j7, still happy with a good budget device from samsung.","Jan, 2016",3455,17275
8433,"SAMSUNG Galaxy On7 (Gold, 8 GB)",Sh****************,5,Awesome phone at 11K!,"I ordered this phone on 4-Nov & was delivered by Flipkart on 5-Nov. 5 stars for Flipkart & WS Retail for delivering on time.    Coming to the phone:  I backed up all data from my previous phone & transferred to On7 smoothly without any hitch. Was using a 32GB SD card.    Pros:  CPU/ GPU: Snapdragon 410 works like a charm. No drag, lag or frame drops what-so-ever after using few high end games.  Also, 1.2GHz Quad core along with placement of SoC makes thermal impact very minimal. So, heating is minimized to a large extent.  Full 5 stars for the design.    Memory: 1.5GB RAM ensures that high end games can also be played with ease (still need to try with Asphalt8 to see how the device handles this game). But a 2GB would have been desirable.  8GB ROM looks less (cant complain much looking at the price range). I had a 32GB external card, so moving most installed Apps to SD card helped. If you are a heavy WhatsApp user, internal memory fills up faster.  3.5 stars for memory config.    Display: 5.5' screen with 720P display is a treat. But TFT screen compared to AMOLED makes it little dull. Still OK.  4 stars for display.    Camera: 13MP Front & 5MP rear -- Picture quality is OK.  4 stars for camera.    - Haven't tested 4G download (& combined download) yet.  - Battery backup (3000 mAh) has been OK till now with heavy App downloads on WiFi & continuous game play. I expect the battery to last atleast a day for a heavy user.    Some people have complained of low audio issue on J5 & J7. I haven't noticed anything of that sort after having calls on both speaker & earphone. The audio quality has been good as of now.    Cons:  Memory: Could have been better with 2GB RAM/ 16GB ROM combination.    Display: AMOLED would have been desirable.    Conclusion:  Full 5 stars for Samsung & the phone. If you are looking for a budget phone with high end features, this has to be it. Completely recommended.","Nov, 2015",1848,9240

I sold 3 years old Samsung Grand 1 phone for 6k on olx within 1 day. Compare to lenovo who took almost 3 month to sold at 4k price.    Cons  1) 8GB (4.5GB usable) is quite less as this phone doesnt give you option to install all apps directly on SD card but you can move few apps. They should have atleast given option to install apps directly on sd card like my old grand phone had.    I would say just click on buy now button and enjoy this master piece at this low price.

The Mobile is equally having the cons and pros but good budget phone around 10k if you like the Samsung brand .Sound is average with the speaker at back end - where you will watch a video at front end and sound will be at back end with very low sound : I exchanged my phone because of this biggest problem in the phone (Thanks again to Flipkart for easy exchange)but later i realized that the issue with the all the phones..Now i am using the phone with a minor help from the volume boosters apps.

8446,LAVA 34 Plus,Ra*************,4,Good quality product,"A value for money phone with relatively more features. Has bluetooth and cam be synced with other devices. Feels solid in hand and has a large display. Call quality is good with good earpiece as well as speaker sound. However I find a few important issues that could be better. The in-phone message storage capacity is just 100. Though we can take backup of messages in a memory card but a higher memory could have been easily given. Also messages have to be deleted one by one in case inbox needs to be cleared. Typing messages also is not easy and smooth. There is a relatively big battery of about 2500 mah, but compared to the earlier samsung feature phones i have used (guru music 2 and metro 313) battery backup is not even close. This is even though the samsungs have far smaller batteries.","Aug, 2020",0,NaN

This set doesn't looks a non-premium phone, at this price range many phones looks low budget but I must say micromax have done a great job in looks. Now about performance, for 2GB , it's only for basic usages. It has optimised version of Android 10 (Android Go) so won't have similar experience like the full version. I bought this phone as my secondary set for business purpose and it works well. They have assured for 2 years of update, so it would be interesting to see in coming days. Battery performance is good and easily gives full day coverage on normal usages. Camera is good too and u can't expect the photos like high end phone.  Perfect for those who would want this for casual streaming and viewing or using as secondary phone. Good work by Micromax, total paisa vasool.",9 months ago,85,425

8487,"Micromax IN 1b (Blue, 32 GB)",Ya*********,5,Super!,"Using mobile since 10 days. So my opinion clearly based on my usage__.    1. Stock Android means clean ui far batter then other phones in this price.  2. Camera is just average.  3. Processor can handle your day to day task very easily without any lag or frame drop.  4. Sound quality is good but I am not happy with the speaker placement.  5. Takes approx 2.5 hours in charging and after full charge you can use mobile 3 days on normal usage.  6. Type-C cable in this price range is superb but I didn't liked the quality of cable provided it looks cheap but ok.  7. Fingerprint sensor is good not too much fast nor too much slow.  8. Build quality is good.  Conclusion- yes, don't listen to people who saying mobile is buggy or hangs a lot it's totally fake I am very happy with handset.    Note:- Yes if you are playing high quality games so it's normal mobile hang toh hoga hi so don't forget it's a 7K device you don't except high quality performance or features it's already comes with maximum features in this budget.",9 months ago,30,150

Photos are so natural, night time photos are too good. Photo quality after zooming is also good. Videos are also good. Better to buy Pro Max for longer battery backup. After heavy use, watching movies, battery consumption is 70% per day in average (no idea about backup for game users). Regarding weight, I am used to it.

8655,"SAMSUNG Galaxy A70s (Prism Crush Red, 128 GB)",Ud**********,5,Great product,Samsung Galaxy a70s super & good but to costly according to me .... I have bought vivo Z1X one month before... both looking same in every thing ... but Samsung hopes better than other .... they say nfc working... it's safe for bank transactions ...

8656,"SAMSUNG Galaxy A70s (Prism Crush Red, 128 GB)",Ka********,1,Did not meet expectations,"Please do not buy this phone on Flipkart. The ear phone does not work, the bio metric especially the finger print unlock does not work it works but only once in 5 to 6 attempts. This phone is almost heats up like an ironbox as if it has an heating element inside and it can doubble up as an portable travel iron box, really not worth buying. This my personal opinion and experience. Really a very bad deal is what I feel. Better opt for Apple or Nokia but not this model. 👎👎👎👎👎","Nov, 2019",416,416

8665,SAMSUNG Guru Music 2,Na*************,5,Great product,This is a brilliant choice if you are looking for a basic phone to avoid the distraction from the smartphone.  The heilight of this product is the battery life (I got 10 days battery backup) and Call clarity; things we want to be perfect in a basic phone.  Apart from that we have music player which will help you enjoy your loneliness....  Altogether it was an astonishing purchase for me,"Dec, 2017",716,3580
8666,SAMSUNG Guru Music 2,Sa***************,4,Good choice,"Light weight, very compact, stylish. keypad is awesome ! buttons were made with rubber finish .phone has good grip in hand. speaker loudness is average . earpiece sound quality is good . phone has some basic functions like timer,world clock,stop watch , converter etc...comes with Sudoku game. earphones which comes with the phone was good in both sound quality and loudness . SAR value is very low which is good for long talkers. overall this is best for those who wants a backup phone and those who takes a lot of calls . torch is not that bright but good enough. the speaker loudness would be more higher which is the only con I found . the price also would be around 1300 then I would give 5 🌟 rating . I m also recommending you ""InFocus power B1"" feature phone. before buying this phone do have a check on InFocus power B1. it's a value for money mobile with 3000 mAh big battery and a gaint 3 LED torch with Bluetooth also !","Jun, 2019",1057,4228

Couldn't be happier with my upgrade from the iPhone SE. I recommend using only up to 15W chargers if you want to avoid the phone becoming unusually warm when plugged in. Charge times are still excellent if you want to slip in a quick charge for 20-30 minutes. It should give you enough battery life for half a day.",1 month ago,116,580
