Display is very good with 120Hz refresh rate, entertainment experience is better.  Performance is very smooth and faster, it is much enough for normal user's.  Speakers are also loud.  Design is very good, in hand feel is awesome.  Realme UI is now a days bringing more bloatware, there was too many pre-installed apps, yes it can be uninstall.

886,Nokia TA-1174 / TA-1299,ajeesh kumar,4,Good quality product,"it's a basic phone you can ask for from a reliable company. Nokia was the king then. but still I would say that it doesn't feel the way Nokia phones used too. The typing isn't smooth as it used to be. rest all its good. Talking about the games it just snake. rest is paid. Charging and the aux port is not surfaced with the body so dust and water would easily find there way in. It supports the full big SIM card, not the nano or micro ones. Also the battery case isn't that easy to open.","Jun, 2018",196
