Battery is 1750 mah which is more than enough for a feature phone. Another remarkablefeature of this phone is it has inbuilt sound amplifier, that's why loudly and clearly music can be listened. This is purely indian origin phone. Feeling proud to be an Indian. Thank you Lava international.",

The camera performance is also upto the mark. There are no such lags upon normal usage (thanks to the Snapdragon processor), although the device gets quite warm when put to charge. Overall it is a good purchase, would have been great if the battery was of at least 5000mAh at this price range. I would surely recommend this phone.",

Battery lasts enough and takes 2.5hrs for full charge. Speed, display working fine. I don't know why Samsung pass is not in my phone. Only problem that I found is rate was decreased in other website just after my phone was delivered. Go for M series from Samsung.",

Keypad is little hard but it will be ok after use. Its small light weight phone solves all the purpose. It needs a memory card to work coz it doesnt have any internal memory. Headset given is not that great but u shudnt expect more in this price. In short its a perfect standby set. Go for it.",
