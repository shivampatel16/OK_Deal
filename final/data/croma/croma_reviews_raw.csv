The built quality of backcover is so so and scratches are a big issue-it could have been better if rear side is supported with Corning Gorilla. It may take some more time to experience the device to the fullest extent as one would know the performance better when I tend to use its most of the features. I have reviewed that the regular updates are occupying space of 1GB almost every alternate day and if this keeps going the same way, then we will need to see how the device's chipset (processor) performs in the coming days.

223828,"Samsung Galaxy A51 (Prism Crush Blue, 128 GB, 6 GB RAM)",Hariharan,4.0,,"Purchased this model 3 weeks back. Here's my impressions so far Positives:  Sleek appealing design with thinner bezels.  Display is awesome and viewing content is a treat to watch. Camera is pretty good.  Though 60Hz refresh rate, it's smooth to navigate between apps or pages. Case and earphones bundled with box is appreciable.  Not so good stuffs The charger wire length is too small and is a pain to connect for charging the phone. Battery is pretty average with roughly 22hr battery life I am getting on average.  Performance (processor) is not the strong point of this phone, but for my usage and for most of common man's usage, this will suffice.  All in all will give 4 out of 5.  P.S: Came to purchase A52, ended up buying A51 as A52 wasn't on display and buying A51 made me feel a better value for money. Saved around 6k, plus case and earphone included. With 5G variant being the future I am happy not spending extra money for a costlier 4G variant A52. Maybe an A52 5G would have tempted me to go for it.  Anyways happy with A51.",2021-05-27T05:41:44+0000,

There are some bloatwares but most of 'em can be removed easily. Cons: Camera quality but use it with gcam mod 8.2 will work like a charm (This also tells us how lazy the smartphone maker companies are, they could not put little effort in optimization of the stock cam app to improve the camera output, such a shame) Single speaker though its loud but can be irritating at times I absolutely hate the back design ( its subjective).
