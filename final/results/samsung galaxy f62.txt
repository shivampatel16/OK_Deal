REVIEWS & RATINGS ACROSS PLATFORMS

						Description : Do not buy before reading this take your time , explore alot and buy. Pros 1. Excellent battery life . 2. Vivid and bright display. 3. Camera is also good. Cons 1. It will become warm (38c) even for normal usage. 2. Not for gamers , playing games make the mobile hotter very soon as a result the performance is also reduces because of he thermal throttling. Tip for gamers It is a good performance  processor and when i said good ,real good but our main villan is the heat. If you are going to play heavy games always keep a table fan near to control the temperature. In about 20 minutes it become hot (42-45c) depending on graphics. Conclusion If you are not a gamer and need a termendous battery life and disply go for it or else go for snapdragon .

						Description : A flagship experience in mid range price  With Knox security (Samsung Pay, Secure folder, samsung pass, alt+z switch), Bixby (voice, dictation, routines and vision), Improved samsung notes, massive 7000 mah battery, Super AMOLED Plus display, Exynos 9825 (better performance than Snapdragon 765, but not THAT suitable for professional gamers), Very intuitive Ul(android 11) and UX(OneUl 3.1), 25W fast charging, USB-C to USB-C cable(charger brick included) and 60 Hz refresh rate (compensated for super amoled+ display), this phone is worth spending on.. Only cons I found is its weight, width and height which takes a few days to get accustomed to; and around 2 hours for full charge.. The looks are a bit compensated for the grand features, but overall experience is superb The device heats up when used heavily but thats not a problem (be optimistic- this heat up checks the heavy usage so that we can spend some time in the REAL world with family and friends

						Description : The image quality in daylight is awesome, but in dim light its not so clear. Also night mode is bad. Front cam quality is fine. Overall working of the phone is great and here one issue I've faced so far is the battery life. Though it is powered by a 7000mah one, the battery life is just up to 1.5 day from last full charge even with normal use (No game, no movies or not much youtube). The phone is a little heavier and that may be difficult for some people to use for a long time. Anyway after my use of first five days, its a good one with decent performance and overall neat value for money product.

						Description : Value for money. Speed is superb. Battery is coming for 2 days exactly. Totally satisfied with the phone with in this range. Using it from past 10days. Without cover back is scraching.    Not got chance to take photos in sunlight.    Drawback: Not caching the LTE signals properly with Airtel. Hope this can be improved with software updates.

						Description : The battery and performance of the phone is excellent. Camera is also good, though there could be more improvements for the price paid. I have tried Night Mode, Digital Zooming and Landscapes, they work great. The diaplay of Super Amoled Plus is very immersive and the Android 11 UI 3.1 is very user friendly. Also if you have Samsung, try using Quick Share option, they are very fast in transferring images from one samsung to another. It takes a while to charge the 7k mAh phone, and heats up wh...

						Description : A fusion of awesomeness and affordability.  The phone feels premium and is a potential flagship killer as it houses a flagship processor giving a buttery smooth experience in all tasks. The image processing is ultra fast and the screen is super smooth.  The Phone is powered by a monstrous 7000 mAh battery which lasts for an average of 2 days. Best phone in 25k segment.  And above all, it is a non-chinese handset. Better than any of those Oppo, vivo, poco, realme, redmi, one plus, etc.

						Description : Finally an amazing product by Samsung which offers great performance. Well we all are pretty much familiar with the pros(as most of us has researched this product on YouTube) now let's discuss the cons:    1. No carrier aggregation, even if the hardware is capable of it (if you don't know what is it just perform a Google search).    2. The Back panel is prone to fingerprints and scratches. Get a case ASAP.    3. The Night mode of both the cameras(front and rear) should have been better but it can...

						Description : I have selected this phone for my father and it's quite useful for their age group as it has a good battery and the display is very good according to my father - it is a treat to watch contents on a super amoled plus display and it's one ui and Android 11.sleek design is also good .Now coming to the cons- samsung should have provided a case inside the box and tempered glass protection as samsung selling point is their display. I have experienced a lil heating issue at the time of charging and...
